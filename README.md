Nests & Insects
===============

This is the repository for the code and rulebooks for Nests & Insects, a Roguelike
Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG).

Nests & Insects is still a work in progress, at the early stages of design and
playtesting.

For now you can check out the game's overview in the rules document under
`games/rulebook/txt/nests_and_insects.txt` (or the .pdf version in the adjacent /pdf
directory).

To read the text-based rulebook, navigate to its directory and open it with a pager like
less or more etc.

```
cd .../games/rulebook/txt/
less nests_and_insects.txt
```

You should then be greeted by the glorious ASCII of the rulebook cover. 

The cover and the rulebook are best rendered in the free font DejaVu Sans Mono. You can
download it from here:
