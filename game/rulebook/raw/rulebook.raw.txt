\chapter{Overview}
\begin*{note_reader}
This Section is a short introduction to the setting, the game and the system of Nests
& Insects. It is designed to give you a general idea of the game. It is not designed
to give you everything you need to play the game. That information is found in the
text that follows this Overview Chapter.
\end{note_reader}

Nests & Insects is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) for 2 to 7 players. One player
assumes the role of the Game Queen and describes the game world to the other players. The
other players control characters who explore, and interact with, the game world.

\section{The Setting}

Players' characters are arthropods that belong to one of six classes: Spider, Wasp,
Scorpion, Ladybug, Beetle and Ants (plural). The characters are mercenaries: assassins
and thugs, hired to invade a Nest and carry out a Job on behalf of some arthropod client.
Nests are the homes of eusocial insects: the nests of Bees, Ants and Termites. Common
Jobs are to assassinate the Queen, or the King; steal nectar, honey, honeydew, aphids
(farmed by ants) or fungi (cultivated by termites); steal, or kill, larvae; and more.

At the beginning of a new game the players' characters enter a Nest to carry out their
Job armed with their natural weapons and armour: mandibles, pincers, stingers, carapaces,
wings, venom, webs. During a Job characters must survive combat with the soldier castes
guarding the Nests. They must also hunt or forage for food to avoid weakening and
starving to death. While foraging, characters may find food items, such as nectar and
fungi, that can be consumed to provide not only sustenance but also healing, enhanced
physical and mental abilities and other benefits.

\section{The Game}

Nests & Insects is a Roguelike TTRPG. It is "Roguelike" because it is inspired by
computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) of the Roguelike genre, like Nethack, Angband, Moria,
Ancient Domains of Mystery, and later games like Diablo and Darkest Dungeon.

A "Roguelike TTRPG" is a case of board games imitating computer games, imitating board
games: most Roguelike CRPGs are inspired by TTRPGs, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, the
grandaddy of all TTRPGs (and all CRPGs to boot). Roguelikes borrow from TTRPGs the
hack-and-slash, dungeon-crawling style of gameplay and common themes of fantasy and
science fiction. Nests & Insects borrows from Roguelike CRPGs game elements like:
procedural generation; hack-and-slash, dungeon-crawling gameplay; lethal combat; hunger
and other resource management mechanics; and freedom to explore the game world.

While Nests & Insects is a roleplaying game, it is not focused on roleplaying, because it
is very difficult for humans to roleplay arthropods (and vice-versa). As in Roguelike
CRPGs, Nests & Insects does not come with a built-in, pre-scripted story, and it is
instead designed to encourage a story to emerge naturally from the interaction of the
players' characters with the rules of the game and the procedurally generated elements of
the game world.

Nests & Insects is designed to be played with no preparation other than reading some of
the rules. At the start of a new game players select a class that determines all of a
character's beginning stats (collectively called Features). The Game Queen then rolls to
procedurally generate the first Room in the entrance to the first Level of the Nest, and
the characters enter and begin their Job. After visiting a Room and defeating its
challenges characters get a chance to rest and recoup their strength, and players can use
experience gained to improve their characters. The game ends when the characters fulfil
the terms of the Job, or give up, or run away, or die.

Everything encountered by characters during a Job is procedurally generated. If the Game
Queen wishes, she can create hand-crafted Rooms, Levels, enemies, items, etc, and include
them in the game; but that is not strictly necessary.

\section{The System}

\begin{table}[4]
Roll matches Effort&       Roll beats Resistance&       Degree of Success
True               &       True                 &       Complete Success
True               &       False                &       Partial Success
False              &       True                 &       Partial Failure
False              &       False                &       Complete Failure
\end{table}
\label{Initial four Degrees of Success.}[table]

Nests & Insects' roleplaying system is called Fuzzy d100 (fd100). fd100 is designed to
eliminate mental arithmetic from the process used to determine the outcome of characters'
actions ("action resolution"). It is a "percentile" system where characters are defined
by "Features" rated on a scale from 1 to 100, and where a d100 is rolled for action
resolution. The d100 in fd100 generates results from "00" to "99".

The "Fuzzy" in the fd100 name refers to the six possible Degrees of Success or Failure of
an action (DoS). To determine the DoS of an action, players describe their character's
Intent, then roll a d100 and compare it to two target numbers, "Effort" and "Resistance".

To roll under Effort is to "match" Effort. To roll over, or equal to, Resistance, is to
"beat" Resistance. If the d100 roll matches Effort, the initial DoS is a Success,
otherwise it is a Failure. If the d100 roll beats Resistance, the initial DoS is a
Complete Success or a Partial Failure, otherwise it is a Partial Success or a Complete
Failure. Table 1 lists the four initial DoS and how they can be achieved.

\subsection{Modifiers}

\begin{table}[4]
Initial DoS     &   Change     &    New DoS
Complete Success&   Shift Up   &    Critical Success
Complete Success&   Shift Down &    Partial Success
Complete Failure&   Shift Up   &    Partial Failure
Complete Failure&   Shift Down &    Critical Failure
\end{table}
\label{Shifts Up and Down conferred by modifiers.}[table]

The initial DoS of an Action is determined by comparing a d100 roll with Effort and
Resistance. This initial DoS may change, or "Shift", up or down, by further comparing the
same d100 roll with additional target numbers, called "modifiers". 

Modifiers can be either positive or negative. Matching a positive modifier confers a
"Shift Up" to the initial DoS. Failing to beat a negative modifier confers a "Shift Down"
to the initial DoS.

A Shift Up moves the DoS from worse to better, and a Shift Down moves it from better to
worse. With enough Shifts Up, the initial DoS may improve beyond Complete Success and
become a Critical Success. With enough Shifts Down the initial DoS may worsen beyond
Complete Failure and become a Critical Failure. Table 2 illustrates Shifts Up and Down
and their effect on the initial DoS.

With modifiers, and the Shifts Up or Down they confer, a total of six DoS can be
achieved. In order from worse to best the six DoS are: Critical Failure, Complete
Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success, Complete Success and Critical Success.

\begin{note}
The way that modifiers work in fd100 is a bit of a departure from the standard in
TTRPGs, where a "modifier" is usually a number added to a roll, or to a character's
stat. In fd100 modifiers are instead target numbers compared to a d100 roll, in the
same way as Effort and Resistance. The purpose of this reform is to avoid mental
arithmetic during the most involved moments of play, for instance, during Combat.
\end{note}

\subsection{Describing results}

What the DoS of an action means depends on a player's description of her character's
Intent. Once the final DoS of an action is known, the Game Queen describes what happens
as a result of the action, taking into account the character's Intent and the DoS. The
better the DoS, the closer the result of an action comes to fully satisfying the
character's Intent.

\subsection{Decile Dice}

\begin{table}[4]
Decile die&  Range    &    Tens die &  Numbered   &  Ones die&  Numbered  
d20       &  0 to 19  &    Not any! &             &  d20     &  0,1,...,19
d40       &  0 to 39  &    d4       &  0,1,...,3  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d60       &  0 to 59  &    d6       &  0,1,...,5  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d80       &  0 to 79  &    d8       &  0,1,...,7  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d100      &  0 to 99  &    d10      &  0,1,...,9  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d120      &  0 to 119 &    d12      &  0,1,...,11 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
\end{table}
\label{Decile dice, used for quantification of percentile effects. d100 is also a}[table]
decile die. The d20 does not need a "tens" die and is rolled on its own.

Some actions require quantification of their results. To quantify the results of actions
on the same percentile scale as characters' Features, Nests & Insects uses "decile dice":
the d20, d40, d60, d80, d120 and the d100 itself. The d20 is a single, twenty-sided die,
with faces numbered 0, 1, ..., 19. The d40, d60, d80, d100 and d120 are composite dice,
comprised of a d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12, respectively, as the "ones" die; and a d10 as
the "tens" die. Both the ones and tens dice have faces numbered 0, 1, ..., n-1, where "n"
is the number of faces on the die. Thus, the d4 has faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, the d6 has
faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

To generate a decile die result, the ones and tens dice of the decile die are rolled
together. Then the tens die is placed to the left of the ones die. Finally the digits on
the top faces of the two dice are read left-to-right, as if reading a printed numeral.
This way, each decile die generates numbers from 00 to one less than the number of faces
on the decile die: 39 on a d40, 59 on a d60, 79 on a d80, 99 on a d100, and 119 on a
d120. The d20 needs no special reading and generates numbers in the range 0 to 19.

\begin{example}
The d60 is a composite decile die comprised of a d6, with faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 as a "tens" die, and a d10, with faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as
a "ones" die. When a d60 roll is made, the d6 and d10 are rolled together, the d6 is
placed to the left of the d10 and the digits showing are read left-to-right. Let a
d60 be rolled and suppose the d6 shows a "0", while the d10 shows a "0": in that
case, the d60 result is "00", or just "0". Suppose the d6 shows a "0" while the d10
shows a "4": in that case, the d60 result is "04", or just "4". Suppose the d6 shows
a "3" while the d10 shows an "8": in that case, the d60 result is "38".
\end{example}

Table 3 lists the six decile dice used in fd100, their component polyhedrals and their
numeric ranges. Decile dice are described in full detail in Section "Decile Dice" in the
"System" Chapter along with some discussion of how to implement them.
\newpage

\subsection{Minigames}

The fd100 rules outlined in the previous sections suffice to resolve most actions a
character may take. To add more variety, and more detail, to the basic rules, fd100
defines a number of "minigames".

Minigames are special sets of rules for situations that are of special interest to a
game. There are four minigames in Nests & Insects: Combat; Survival and Exploration;
Hunting and Foraging; and Resting and Healing. 

Minigames are described in detail in Section "Minigames" of the "System" Chapter. Below,
Combat is briefly described as an example of a minigame.

\subsubsection{Combat Minigame}

\begin{table}[8]
Degree of Success&        Outcome
Critical Success &        Base and Special Attacks Hit
Complete Success &        Special Attack Hits
Partial Success  &        Base Attack Hits
Partial Failure  &        Base Attack Misses
Complete Failure &        Special Attack Misses
Critical Failure &        Base and Special Attacks Miss
\end{table}
\label{Outcomes of an Attack Action in the Combat minigame.}[table]

In the Combat minigame, characters have two Attack actions: a Base Attack and a Special
Attack. The DoS of a character's Attack action determines which Attack hits, or misses.

When an Attack hits, it inflicts "Wounds" to the target, and may bestow detrimental
effects on enemies, or beneficial effects on allies. When an Attack misses, the attacker
may suffer Wounds and detrimental effects. Wounds cause the DoS of subsequent actions to
Shift Down. Too many Wounds can kill a character dead.

The Combat minigame also tracks characters' Disposition, representing their position in
battle and their morale. Better Disposition causes the DoS of subsequent Combat actions
to Shift Up. Worse Disposition causes the DoS to Shift Down. 

Table 4 shows the "action formula" of the Attack Action that characters can take during
Combat. In the same way, the other three minigames define formulae for their own special
actions.

\newpage

\chapter{Character}

In Nests & Insects players control "characters", imaginary game entities that represent
arthropod mercenaries on a Job to invade a Nest. Players control their characters by
describing their characters' actions, then the players roll the dice to find out what
happens. The Game Queen reads the dice and determines the outcome of the characters'
actions, according to the rules of the game.

Nests & Insects characters belong to one of six classes: Ants (plural), Beetle, Ladybug,
Scorpion, Spider and Wasp. The six classes are modelled on real-world insect and arachnid
species, but no class is meant to represent a particular species in detail- let alone
with realism.

The following sections describe the Nests & Insects characters, their classes, their
Features, and the character sheets that record their Features.

\newpage

\section{Character Selection}

To begin playing the game, players select one of the six character classes to be their
character's class.

Each character class can be selected at most once by any player in the group. In other
words: no two players can play the same character class in the same game.

There is no character creation, or character generation phase, as is common in CRPG
Roguelikes and TTRPGs, alike. Each character of the same class has exactly the same
starting Features with the exact same ratings, determined by the class' character sheet.

To play a character, a player simply prints out the character sheet for her character's
class, or copies it to her device so she can read and modify it during the game.

Once all players have selected a character, the game begins.
\newpage

\section{Character Death}

When a character dies, the player is free to select a new character.

The new character begins in the same Room of the Nest as the other players' characters.

The new character can be of the same class as the character who died, or of a different
class, if that class is not currently taken (i.e. if another player is not playing a
character of the desired class).

\subsection{Bidding for a class}

If a class is taken when a player's character dies, and the player wants to play a
character of the taken class, the player can "bid" for the class.

To bid for a class, the player informs the Game Queen that she (the player) wishes to
play a character of her desired class the next time one will become available.

A class becomes available when no characters of that class are currently alive in the
game, and controlled by a player.

Multiple players may bid for the same class.

When a class becomes available, the first player who bid for the class can select the
class for her character and join the game with a fresh character of the desired class.

If there are no living characters of a given class in the game and there are no bids for
that class, then any player who wants to play a character of that class, can select the
class without further ceremony.

\subsection{The Cost of Death}

The only mechanical consequence of character death is that a player must start with a
fresh character, with base stats, without XP and without any Items (though some of the
Items in a dead character's Inventory may remain on the floor of the Nest). Nests &
Insects does not enforce any penalties for character death. Whether, and to what degree,
a player is unhappy with the death of her character is left entirely up to the player.

\newpage
\charsheet[template]

\section{Character Sheet}

In Nests & Insects characters are described by percentile-rated Features, listed in a
character sheet specific to a character's class.

There are five categories of Features: Attributes, Combat Conditions, Survival Features,
Abilities and Inventory Items. Features and their use in the game are described in detail
in the "Features" Section of the "System" Chapter. This Section briefly introduces the
different Features as they are listed in the character sheet.

Each character class has its own character sheet, based on the character sheet template
in the preceding page, with its own, pre-set, values. The Character Sheet is divided into
5 areas, some with sub-areas. These are listed in Table 5.

\begin{table}[4]
Area Name   &   Sub-Areas
Class Header&   None

\end{table}
\label{Areas and sub-areas in a character sheet.}[table]

The following Sections describe each area and sub-area of the character sheet.
\newpage

\subsection{Class Header}

The first area in a character sheet is its Class Header (Figure 1), listing the name of
the game and the name of a character's Class.

╔►Nests & Insects◄═════════════════════════════════════════════════════►Character Sheet◄╗

replaced by the name of the character's class, e.g. Wasp, Spider, Ants, etc.
\newpage

\subsection{Attributes Area}

Under the Class Header is the Attributes Area (Figure 2), listing Class Attributes.
Attributes are Features that represent innate abilities of characters in a Class.

╠►Attributes◄═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Attributes Area.}[figure]

Nests & Insects characters have eight Attributes (Table 6).

\begin{table}[6]
Attribute&       Description
Speed    &       How fast the character can move
Skill    &       Dexterity, precision and fine manipulation ability
Strength &       Physical strength, used to push, pull, lift, throw, and break doo- stuff
Stamina  &       Physical toughness and endurance, resistance to physical harm
Smarts   &       Intelligence, logic, reasoning and problem solving skill
Charms   &       Charisma, talent for communication and influencing others' behaviour
Ken      &       Wisdom, common sense, and knowledge of the world
Passions &       Willpower, morale, strength of spirit and courage
\end{table}
\label{Character Attributes.}[table]

_XP Tickboxes_ In the Attributes Area each attribute is listed with an empty tickbox to
the left, marked "XP", as shown in Figure 3. This is an *XP tickbox*. "XP" stands for
"Experience Points". XP tickboxes are also found next to Combat Conditions, Survival
Features and Common Abilities.

┌────────────────────
│ ✓ Speed....:[___0%]
│ □ Smarts...:[___0%]
└<^XP>───────────────
─────────────────────
\label{Ticked XP tickbox for Speed.}[figure]

An XP tickbox is ticked to indicate that the relevant Feature has a chance to increase.
Figure 3 shows the Speed XP tickbox ticked with the ✓ character (U+2713).
\newpage

\subsection{Combat Stats Area}

The Combat Stats area starts with the Combat Stats header (Figure 4).

╠►Combat Stats◄════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Header of the Combat Stats Area.}[figure]

The Combat Stats area lists Features used in the Combat minigame. It has 3 sub-areas: the
Condition box, the Disposition Track and the Attack boxes.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Condition box}

The Condition box (Figure 5) lists a character's Initiative, Threat Rate, Survival Rate
and Wounds.
┌[Condition]──────────────<Rules Reminder>──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ □ Initiative...:[___0%] (Match/Beat to start Combat in Holding/Recoiling Disposition) │
│ □ Threat Rate..:[___0%] (Match/Beat Attacker's TR to Hit/Miss Target)................ │
│ □ Survival Rate:[___0%] (Match/Beat Target's SR to Hit/Miss with Base/Special Attack) │
│ □ Wounds/Max...:[__/_3] (1 Wound = 1 Shift Down. When Wounds ≥ Max, character dies).. │
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Condition box.}[figure]

The Condition box includes some reminder text to help players make sense of their
character's Condition in Combat. The four Combat Conditions are explained, briefly,
below.

* Initiative determines a character's initial Disposition, and Turn order, in Combat.

* Threat Rate is used as the Effort of an attacker in Attack Actions.

* Survival Rate is used as the Resistance of an Attack's target in Attack Actions.

* Wounds count the injury caused by attacks. If the count of Wounds reaches its Maximum,
  the character is killed. The default number of Wounds is 3.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Disposition Track}

The Disposition Track (Figure 6) follows a character's Disposition, a representation of
both position and morale in Combat.

├─<Disposition Track>───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ (Advance this way -->) ........................................ (<-- Recoil this way) │
│ ○ Retreating...... ○ Recoiling..... ○ Holding...... ○ Advancing...... ○ Charging..... │
└<^Cant Attack>─────<^-30%>──────────<^Doing Good>───<^+30%>───────────<^Shift Up>──────┘
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Disposition Track. Modifiers apply to all Actions in Combat.}[figure]

The Disposition Track includes reminder text to point out the direction in which
Disposition Advances (increases) or Recoils (decreases) in Combat. Disposition is better
the further it moves towards "Charging".

There are five Dispositions in the Disposition Track, discussed briefly below.

* Retreating: The character is running away from enemies and cannot Attack, or support
  Allies, or take any offensive action.

* Recoiling: The character is falling back, or taken aback, by the force of an Attack.

* Holding: the character is steady and ready to attack and defend.

* Advancing: the character is bold and advancing towards the enemy.

* Charging: the character is impetuous and is Charging ahead Attacking in full force.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Attack boxes}

The Attack boxes (Figure 7) list the details of a character's two Attacks: her Base
Attack and Special Attack. Each character class has its own Base and Special Attacks.

┌[Base Attack]─────────────────────────────┐┌[Special Attack]──────────────────────────┐

\subsection{Survival Area}

The Survival Area begins with the Survival Header (Figure 8).

╠►Survival◄════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Survival header, demarcating the Survival Area.}[figure]

The Survival Area has two sub-Areas: the Food box, used in the Survival minigame; and the
Luck box.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Food box}

The Food box (Figure 9) lists the character's Hunger rating and has a radio-button for
the Starving Effect. Starving is ticked when Hunger reaches 100%. While Starving, a
character takes a penalty in the DoS of all minigame Actions.

┌[Food]───────────────────┐

\subsubsection{Luck box}

The Luck box (Figure 10) lists the character's Luck. Luck is used to avoid the worst
outcome of Actions, Attacks and events in the game. The current Luck rating is marked by
an up-arrow (^) in the bottom of the Luck box.

┌[Luck]───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [11%].[22%].[33%].[44%].[55%].[66%].[77%].[88%].[99%].[00%].│
└──^──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Luck box, with the Luck marker on 11% (starting Luck).}[figure]

Characters start the game with 11% Luck. During the game a character's Luck rating
changes whenever the player rolls a d100 and the same digit appears on both d10s. This is
known as "rolling a double". When a double is rolled, the Luck marker is moved to the
rating that matches the double.
\newpage

\subsection{Abilities Area}

The Abilities Area begins with the Abilities header (Figure 11).

╠►Abilities◄═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Abilities header, demarcating the Abilities area.}[figure]

The Abilities Area has four sub-Areas: the Specific Abilities box, the Common Abilities
box, the Effects box and the Inventory box.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Specific Abilities box}

The Specific Abilities box (Figure 12) lists Abilities that are particular to a Species
(hence, "Specific"). Nests & Insects classes model individuals of a species hence each
character class has its own Specific Abilities.

┌[Specific Abilities]────────┐
│ Carapace..........:[___0%] │
│ Flying............:[___0%] │
│ Swarming..........:[___0%] │
│ Venomous..........:[___0%] │
│ Web Weaving.......:[___0%] │
└────────────────────────────┘
──────────────────────────────
\label{Specific Abilities box.}[figure]

There are five Specific Abilities that character classes can have: Carapace, Flying,
Swarming, Venomous, or Web Weaving. These are briefly described below.

* Carapace: the character has a hardened carapace that protects her in combat. Beetle,
  Ladybug and Scorpion have Carapace.

* Flying: the character can fly. Flying characters are harder to hit in Combat by
  terrestrial attackers. Beetle, Ladybug and Wasp have Flying.

* Swarming: the character is a swarm of individual insects, or can summon conspecifics to
  assist her.

  In Combat, a character with high Swarming ignores all Wound penalties, but with each
  Wound, an individual is lost from the Swarm. Ants have high Swarming. 

  A character with low Swarming starts as a single individual but can summon more
  individuals of her species. Wasp has low Swarming.

* Venomous: the character has a venomous bite or sting and can bestow Effects such as
  Agony, Immobilised, Paralysed, or Poisoned to enemies in Combat, or otherwise.

* Web Weaving: the character can weave webs. Webs can be used to set traps or secure an
  area. Spider has Web Weaving.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Common Abilities box}

The Common Abilities box (Figure 13) lists Abilities common to all character classes.

┌[Common Abilities]────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ □ Construction.....:[___0%] □ Hunting...........:[___0%] │

Like Atributes and Conditions, Common Abilities have an XP Tickbox and can be improved
with experience. Table 7 briefly describes Common Abilities and their use.

\begin{table}[8]

\end{table}
\label{Common Abilities with brief description.}[table]
\newpage

\subsubsection{Effects box}

The Effects box (Figure 14) lists ten Effects that a character can be subject to.

Effects are generally detrimental conditions that can affect a character as a result of
Attacks in Combat, and other minigames.

┌[Effects]───────────────────────────────────┐
│ ○ Agony....:[___0%] ○ Immobilised.:[___0%] │
│ ○ Bleeding.:[___0%] ○ Infected....:[___0%] │

└<^Applies>──────────<^Applies>──────────────┘
──────────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Effects box.}[figure]

Effects each have a radio button. When this is ticked it marks that the Effect "Applies",
i.e. that the character is currently subject to the Effect. The ten Effects in the Effect
box are listed in Table 8 along with a brief description of each.

\begin{table}[6]
Effect     &    The character...
Agony      &    ...is in agony and must overcome her pain to act
Bleeding   &    ...automatically takes a Wound each Combat Turn

Charmed    &    ...joins her enemies and fights against her Allies
Confused   &    ...has a chance to Attack her Allies instead of enemies
Immobilised&    ...cannot move and can only Attack in close range
Infected   &    ...acquires a random Effect each Turn this Effect Applies
Paralysed  &    ...cannot take any Actions
Poisoned   &    ...has a negative modifier equal to Poisoned to all Actions
Stunned    &    ...loses her next Turn in Combat
\end{table}
\label{Effects, with brief description of how a character is affected.}[table]
\newpage

\subsubsection{Inventory box}

The Inventory box (Figure 15) lists a character's possessions such as Food items, slaved
Prey, and other items.

┌[Inventory]───────────────────────────────┐
│ ○ ______________________________:[____%] │
│ ○ ______________________________:[____%] │

\label{Inventory box.}[figure]

Each line in the Inventory box is an Inventory item. Items have a "Depleted" radio button
that indicates whether the item has been depleted as a result of its use.

Characters can only carry as many Items as there are lines in the Inventory box: that is
5 lines, for 5 items.

\section{Character Classes (TBD)}

\newpage
\charsheet[ants]

\section{Ants}

Pronouns: they/them/theirs
--------------------------

Diet: Omnivore
--------------

Description
-----------

Ants are descended from wasps, an ancestry evident in their form that indeed resembles
that of a wingless wasp with geniculate (bent) antennae and a particularly narrow waist.

Most Ants are eusocial, meaning that they live in nests with overlapping generations all
born of a single reproductive female, the Queen. Accordingly, Nests & Insects Ants
characters are a "swarm" of ten ants, rather than a single individual ant. When an Ants
character takes a Wound in Combat or otherwise, one ant is lost from the swarm. The
character suffers no penalties for Wounds, but if the character's Wounds reach their
maximum of 10, the character is killed as usual.

The Ants character in Nests & Insects is modelled after army ants (of which there are
many species). The Ants character is blind and its individual ants represent soldiers of
their species, armed with powerful mandibles. When an Ants character attacks an enemy,
all the ants in the swarm pile on and try to take chunks out of their target.
Mechanically speaking, the Damage caused by Ants character attacks is a function of the
character's Wounds: the more Wounds, the more ants, the more Damage.

The downside of being a swarm is that an Ants character's Wounds cannot be replenished
with healing during Combat. Rather, the Ants character must actively summon new ants
using their Swarming ability, and only during the Resting and Healing minigame.

Ants characters have no carapace and cannot fly.

\newpage
\charsheet[beetle]

\section{Beetle}

Pronouns: he/him/his
--------------------

Diet: Vegetarian (but see Description)
--------------------------------------

Description
-----------

Beetles are the armoured knights of the insect kingdom¹. They have an outer pair of wings
modified into a hardened wing-case, the elytra (Greek for "sheaths"), that protect their
delicate flying wings and also, their bodies. Their heads are large and armoured, and
armed with powerful mandibles that can deliver crushing bites. Beetles' heads come in a
wild variety of shapes, sizes and forms, specialised for digging, fighting, or feeding.

The Nests & Insects Beetle character class is modelled after the European rhinoceros
beetle. These beetles' heads are armed with horns that they normally use in mating fights
with other males; in the game, they use them to attack Nests' guardians. They can fly,
but their elytra make them clumsy and slow fliers. They can, however, combine their
flying abiity and their horned head to perform a devastating cannonbal attack that can
strike right at the heart of a swarm.

Beetle characters are adults of their species and do not need to feed: they subsist
during their short lives on the food consumed as larvae. Mechanically speaking, Beetle
characters' Hunger rating is replaced with the word NONE and cannot change with the
consumption of Food items. Beetle characters cannot become Starving. They can, however,
benefit from the effects of Food items such as Nectars or Fungi, thus their Diet is
recorded as "vegetarian" for this purpose only.

feed.

\charsheet[scorpion]

\section{Scorpion}

Pronouns: he/him/his
--------------------

Diet: Carnivore

Description
-----------

Scorpions are not insects! They are arthropods, like insects, but they belong to their
own taxonomic Class, Arachnida (the Arachnids), along with spiders. Scorpions, like most
Arachnids, have eight legs and a front pair of appendages, their frightful pincers,
specialised to grasp and manipulate, in particular, their food. Scorpions' tails are
armed with their fearful stinger that injects an extremely painful, lethal venom.
Scorpions can move with precision on their eight legs but are slowed down by their tough
exoskeleton that functions as a carapace armour. Nests & Insects Scorpions can use their
excellent Leadership to support their allies in Combat by improving their Disposition.
They can also use their Signalling to perform an aggressive display showcasing their
pincers and stinger in such a fashion as to frighten their enemies and worsen their
Disposition.

\section{Spider}

Pronouns: she/her/hers.
-----------------------

Diet: Carnivore
---------------

Description
-----------

Like Scorpions, Spiders are Arachnids- indeed, the Class Arachnida is named after the
Greek name of Spider, *Arachne*. Spiders, like most Arachnids, have eight legs and two
front appendages, called the pedipalps, that function like external mouthparts. Spiders
can move very fast and with great precision on their eight legs. They are frightfully
clever and use their intelligence to hunt and ambush prey. The defining characteristic of
spiders is their ability to weave webs. In Combat, Nests & Insects Spiders' webs can
immobilise enemies or stabilise allies bleeding hemolymph (the web essentially acts as a
bandage). Spiders' bites inject venom that can paralyse prey, and can heal allies,
removing their Wounds. They are, unfortunately quite frail and have no carapace to
protect them from attacks.

\newpage
\charsheet[wasp]

\section{Wasp}

Pronouns: me/ ME/ MINE!
-----------------------

Diet: Vegetarian

Description
-----------

Wasps are mean, flying killing machines. Wasps are fast and precise fliers capable of
hovering in place. They have yellow- or orange-and-black aposematic stripes that warn
enemies of their deadlinesss. Their Stings inject lethal venom, but unlike Spiders'
venom, Nests & Insects' Wasp venom can only wound, not heal. Unlike Bees, Wasps do not
lose their stings and die when they sting an enemy, so they can keep stinging away for as
long as they like.

In Nests & Insects Wasps are high-mobility, shock troops optimised for menoeuverability
and damage, but they have soft bodies without a protective carapace armour. They can use
their high Signalling to perform aggessive displays of their death stripes and drain the
morale of their enemies, thus reducing their Disposition. Wasps have good knowledge of
eusocial insects' domains thanks to their high Eusociology, acquired while raiding the
nests of Bees, and tending to their own. They are excellent at Foraging and can identify
valuable or dangerous Food items.

feared by its enemies, and equipped with good survival skills.

\newpage

\subsection{Attributes (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsection{Combat Conditions (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsection{Survival Featues (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsection{Abilities (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsection{Effects}

This Section defines the rules for handling Effects. Effects are physical or mental
conditions that may affect a character during the course of a game. 

The Effects rules rely on the rules for Boolean Rolls in Section 3.4.2.1. and the rules
for Quantification in Section 3.4.1.6. You may need to reference those Sections while
reading the current Section.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Effects ratings}

Nests & Insects characters may be subject to ten Effects, all of which are detrimental.
The ten Effects are listed in the character sheet, in the Effects box, in the Abilities
area.

Each Effect in the Effects box has a rating, and a tickbox marked "Applies".

When the rating of an Effect on a character's sheet is more than 0% we say that the
character is "subject to" the Effect. Alternatively, we say that the Effect "applies" to
the character.

The "Applies" tickbox next to an Effect serves as a reminder that the Effect applies to
the character. Tick it when the Effect's rating increases above 0%. Remember to untick it
when the Effect's rating is reduced to 0%.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Acquiring Effects}

Most characters start with all Effects in their character sheet rated at 0%.

Some characters begin the game subject to an Effect. For example, Ants start with Blind:
100%.

A character may acquire an Effect during the course of the game. Characters acquire
Effects as a result of:

* their Actions, 

* or the Actions of enemies, 

* or the Events that occur while they explore the Nest.

When a character acquires an Effect, we say that the Effect is "bestowed" on the
character.

When an Effect is bestowed on a character, the Effect's rating may increase above 0% and
the character become subject to the Effect.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Checking Effects}

When a character is subject to one or more Effects, those Effect must be checked during
Combat, Survival and Exploration, or Hunting and Foraging. Each minigame determines when
Effects must be "checked".

When the rules of a minigame say that Effects must be checked, all Effects a character is
subject to are checked simultanously.

To check all Effects a character is subject to, make a single Boolean Roll. The
character's player makes the roll.

Compare the result of the Boolean Roll to each Effect that the character is subject to,
in turn. 

For each Effect checked this way:

* If the Boolean Roll beats the Effect's rating, the character is no longer subject to
  that Effect.

  In that case, reduce the rating of the Effect to 0%.

  Also untick its "Applies" tickbox as a reminder that it no longer applies.

* If the Boolean Roll matches the Effect's rating, the Effect "triggers".

\begin{note}
An Effect that triggers continues to apply. It must be checked again next time a
minigame's rules say Effects must be checked.
\end{note}

The next Section descirbes how to handle triggered Effects.
\newpage
%\subsubsection{Triggered Effects}
%
%When an Effect is checked, the character who is subject to the Effect may suffer from
%the consequences of the Effect. In that case we say that the Effect "triggers".

\subsubsection{Agony}

When an Agony Effect triggers the subject character has a chance to become Stunned.

Make a Boolean Roll with Effort equal to the character's Passions rating.

* If the Roll succeeds, nothing happens. The character is not Stunned.

* If the Roll fails, the character acquires a Stunned Effect.

  In that case, make a Quantification Roll to set the Stunned Effect.

  The Quantification Die for the Roll is the decile die corresponding to the rating
  of the character's Agony Effect. Cross-reference the Agony rating on Table 20
  ("Quantification Dice").

  The Stunned Effect triggers.

  See the rules for triggering the Stunned Effect at the end of this Section.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Bleeding}

When a Bleeding Effect triggers the character takes one Wound.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Charmed}

When a Charmed Effect triggers the subject character automatically attacks one of the
other player characters in the same Room with her. 

Select a character at random to be the target of the Charmed character's Attack (roll a
die). Then:

* If the character is participating in Combat, the character changes Sides: she joins the
  Side of her erstwhile enemies.

* Otherwise, Combat begins. The Charmed character is on one Side and all other player
  characters in the same Room are her enemies.

See Section 3.6.0.0. for the rules of Combat. See Section 3.6.2.2. for the rules of
determining Combat Sides.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Confused}

When a Confused Effect triggers the subject character has a chance to attack her
erstwhile allies.

Make a Boolean Roll with Effort equal to the character's Smarts rating.

If the Roll fails the character attacks one of the other player characters in the same
Room with her.

Select a character at random to be the target of the Attack (roll a die). Then:

* If the character is participating in Combat, the character changes Sides: she joins the
  Side of her erstwhile enemies.

* Otherwise Combat begins between the Confused character and the target of her Attack.

  In that case, the Confused character is on one Side and the character she attacked is
  her enemy.

  Other player characters can join Combat or act otherwise.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Immobilised}

When an Immobilised Effect triggers, nothing special happens.

However, an Immobilised character cannot take any actions that would initiate a Survival
and Exploration or Hunting and Foraging minigame.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Infected}

When an Infected Effect triggers, the subject character acquires a new Effect, or one of
her Effects gets worse.

* If the character has any Effects with 0% rating on her sheet, Select one of those
  Effects at random (roll a die).

  The character acquires the selected Effect. Tick the Effect's "Applies" tickbox as a
  reminder.

  Make a Quantification Roll to set the newly-acquired Effect.

  The Quantification Die for the Roll is the decile die corresponding to the rating of
  the character's Infected Effect. Cross-reference the Infected rating on Table 20
  ("Quantification Dice").

  Write the new Effect's rating on the character's sheet.

  The newly acquired Effect triggers.

* If the character has no Effects with 0% rating, instead select an Effect on the
  character's sheet at random.

  Include the Infected Effect itself in the randomised selection.

  Make a Quantification Roll to increase the rating of the selected Effect.

  The Quantification Die for the Roll is the decile die corresponding to the rating of
  the character's Infected Effect.

  Update the Effect's rating on the character's sheet.

  The increased Effect triggers.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Paralysed}

When a Paralysed Effect triggers, nothing special happens.

However, a Paralysed character cannot take any actions until she is no longer Paralysed.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Poisoned}

When a Poisoned Effect triggers, make a Quantification Roll to increase Poisoning.

A character subject to a Poisoned Effect has a static, negative modifier equal to her
Poisoned rating to all Actions.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Stunned}

When a Stunned Effect triggers, the subject character cannot take any Actions until she
is no longer Stunned.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Removing Immobilised, Paralysed or Stunned}

A character subject to an Immobilised, Paralysed or Stunned Effect cannot take some, or
any, actions. Consequently she cannot remove the Effect restricting her. However, she
will get another chance to shake off her Immobilised, Stunned or Paralysed when an
Effects Cost is next paid.

This may happen immediately after the current Cost is paid, if multiple Cost Events were
generated as a result of an Exploration Action. Or, the character's friends may have to
carry her through to another Room hoping for a new Effects Cost to be generated. Or the
GQ can houserule this one as she feels fit. Use imagination.

\newpage

\subsection{Inventory Items}

Inventory Items are characters' Features representing consumable resources carried by a
character and that the character must use in order to take certain Actions, or to pay
certain Costs during the Survival and Exploration, Hunting and Foraging or Resting and
Healing minigames.

Players' characters start with one Inventory Item each, determined by their Class.
Characters may also find and pick up new Items during Survival and Exploration and
Hunting and Foraging.

Inventory Items carried by a characer are recorded on the character's sheet, in the
Inventory box, in the Abilities Area.

Like all Features, Inventory Items have a descriptive name and a rating that represents
the amount of the relevant resource. Items also have types that describe their use,
recorded in parentheses next to the Item's name. One type of Item are Food Items that can
be eaten to fend off Hunger or grant special abilities.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Carrying Items}

Inventory Items are carried about the character's person and kept track of in the
character's Inventory. A character can only carry as many Items as there are entry
"slots" in her Inventory. Characters' Inventories have five Slots.

Inventory Slots are blank lines, with a radio button and a rating field. The radio button
is to record the Item as "Depleted" (See Section "Consuming Items", later in this
Chapter).

○ ______________________________:[____%]  ○ Blue Nectar of Paralysis______:[__38%]
────────────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────────────────────
\label{An empty Inventory Slot (left) and a Slot holding an Item (right).}[figure]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Acquiring Items}

Characters acquire Inventory Items in one of two ways:

* All character classes start with one Inventory Item recorded on their character sheet.
  In that case an Item's initial rating and its Types are listed on the character sheet.

* Characters may find new Inventory Items as Risks or Rewards generated during the
  Survival and Exploration, or Hunting and Foraging minigames. In that case, an Item's
  initial rating is generated by a Quantification Roll according to the rules of Survival
  and Exploration. 
% If an Item is Food, this is listed in the Item's listing (TBD).

See Section "Quantification" under "Taking Actions" in the "System" Chapter for a
description of Quantification Rolls.

_Recording New Items_ When a new Item is acquired, add an entry for it in an empty Slot
in the character's Inventory. If the character's Inventory is full, the item is dropped
instead (no entry is made for it in the character's Inventory).

\newpage

\subsubsection{Dropping Items}

Items may be "dropped" from a character's Inventory either automatically, when the
character picks up an Item and her Inventory is already full; voluntarily, when the
player decides it; or as a result of game events. 

_Dropped Items_ Dropped Items are removed from a character's Inventory and cannot be used
anymore, unless they are picked up again.

_Automatically dropping Items_ When a character tries to pick up a new Item and her
Inventory is already full, the item is "dropped" instead. No entry is made for the Item
in the character's Inventory.

_Voluntarily dropping Items_ A character is free to "drop" Items from her Inventory at
any time, to make space for other Items, or for any other reason. 

_Inert Items_ When an Inventory Item is "dropped" it is left lying on the floor of the
Nest in the Room where the character is currently in. Characters (including the character
who dropped an Item), or Nest denizens, may pick up dropped Items and add them to their
own Inventory.

_Lost Items_ Dropped Items stay on the floor of a Room where they were dropped, but have
a chance to be lost. Lost Items disappear, and they can no longer be found or picked up.
When all characters leave a Room where an Item was dropped (by anyone) the GQ makes a
Boolean Roll with Effort equal to 100 minus the Nest Level of the Room. If the Roll
succeeds, the Item remains on the Room floor. If the Roll fails, the Item is lost.

See Section "Boolean Roll" under "Simplified Rolls" in the "System" Chapter for a
description of Boolean Rolls. See Section "Nest Levels" under "Survival and Exploration"
in the "System" Chapter for a description of Nest Levels.

_Cursed Items_ Some Items are cursed and may not be removed from a character's Inventory,
until their curse is lifted. An Item is cursed if its name starts with the word "Cursed".

○ Cursed Black Fungus of Death__:[__56%]
────────────────────────────────────────
\label{A Cursed Inventory Item; it cannot be dropped until the Curse is lifted.}[figure]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Item Types}

Inventory Items can belong to one of six types. An Item's type is recorded next to its
name on a character's sheet, in square brackets. The six Item types are listed in Table
8, below, along with a type symbol used to record the Item's type in a character's
Inventory, and a brief description of each type:

\begin{table}[4]
Item Type &   Symbol&   Description
Companion &   [C]   &   A creature accompanying a character. May be edible.
Food      &   [F]   &   Used to pay a Hunger Cost. May bestow Effects, grant Abilities.
Hint      &   [H]   &   May provide useful information.
Light     &   [L]   &   Used to pay a Darkness Cost. May be edible.
Materials &   [M]   &   Used to build a Shelter for Resting and Healing.
Message   &   [S]   &   Must be collected or delivered as part of a Job.
\end{table}
\label{Item Types.}[table]

_Recording Item Types_ To record an Item's type on a character's Sheet, write its type
symbol in square brackets next to the Item's Name in the character's Inventory.

○ Crickets [F]__________________:[__45%]
────────────────────────────────────────
\label{A Food Item in an Inventory slot.}[figure]

_Items With Multiple Types_ Some Items may have multiple types, the "Food" type, and one
or more other types. Such Items can be used to pay a Hunger Cost and perform another
function, such as paying a Darkness Cost. 

○ Gloworm [F,L]_________________:[__45%]
────────────────────────────────────────
\label{An Item with multiple Types: Food and Light.}[figure]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Changing Item Types}

The types of an Item may change. This happens when an Item is eaten, or when it spoils. 

_Eaten Items_ When a Food Item is eaten, all types it has other than Food are removed
from it and the Item can henceforth only be used as a Food Item. The Item's name is
changed to indicate it is only Food, by appending the word "Carcass" or "Remains" to its
original name.

\begin{example}
Cody's Spider character has a Gloworm: 45% Item in her Inventory. The Gloworm Item
has types Food and Light. Spider must pay a Hunger Cost and Cody decides that she
will eat some of the Gloworm to pay it. The Gloworm is now no longer a Light Item.
Cody changes the Gloworm's name on Spider's character sheet to "Gloworm Carcass" as a
reminder that the Gloworm is now only useable as Food.
\end{example}

○ Gloworm [L,F]_________________:[__45%] │  ○ Gloworm Carcass [F]___________:[__45%] │
──────────────────────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Spider's Gloworm (left) and its Carcass (right) after it was eaten.}[figure]

_Spoiled Items_ Food Items can become spoiled as the result of paying a Spoilage Cost
during the Survival and Exploration or Hunting and Foraging minigames. Spoiled Items are
past their expiry date and cannot be consumed without risking adverse effects. The name
of Spoiled Food Items is prepended with "Spoiled" to indicate their Spoiled status.

\begin{example}
Brody's Ants character is carrying a Food Item named "Red Fungus of Collocation". The
Item becomes Spoiled as the result of paying a Spoilage Cost. Brody changes the name
of the Item to indicate it's spoiled. The Item is now called: "Spoiled Red Fungus of
Collocation".
\end{example}

○ Red Fungus of Collocation [F]_:[__45%] │  ○ Spoiled Red Fungus of Col. [F]:[__45%] │
──────────────────────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────
\label{The Ants' Red Fungus before (left) and after (right) becoming spoiled.}[figure]

_Abbreviating Item Names_ As can be seen from the example in Figure 21, Items' names may
end up too long for an Inventory slot. In that case, simply abbreviate the Item's name.
In particular, if an Item's name is too long it does not need to "wrap" to take an
additional Inventory slot: the rule is "one item, one Inventory slot".

\newpage

\subsubsection{Consuming Items}

Inventory Items are "consumed" and may become "depleted" or "exhausted" as a result
of taking an Action or paying a Cost. A depleted Item can still be used, but if it is
depleted again it becomes exhausted.

_Consumption Roll_ To consume an Inventory Item to take an Action or pay a Cost, make a
Boolean Roll. The Effort for the Roll is the Item's rating. The Roll is made immediately
after the Action is resolved, or in the process of paying the Cost.

* If the Roll succeeds, the Item remains unchanged.

* If the Roll fails and the Item is not depleted, the Item becomes depleted. Tick the
  "Depleted" radio button next to the Item in the character's Inventory.

* If the Roll fails and the Item is depleted, the Item becomes exhausted. Remove the Item
  from the character's Inventory.

The player of the character taking the Action or paying the Cost makes the Roll and
modifies the character's Inventory.

\begin{example}
The GQ tells Cody that his Spider character must pay a Hunger Cost. Spider has a Moth
Carcass 23% Food Item in her Inventory that can be consumed to pay Hunger Costs. The
Moth Carcass is not yet depleted. Cody decides that Spider will eat the Moth Carcass
to pay the Hunger Cost. He rolls d100 against the Moth Carcass' 23% rating; result:
45. The Boolean Roll fails and the Moth Carcass Item becomes depleted. Cody ticks the
"Depleted" radio button next to the Moth Carcass Item as a reminder of its status.
\end{example}

○ Moth Carcass__________________:[__23%] │  ✓ Moth Carcass__________________:[__23%] │
^Depleted>───────────────────────────────┘  ^Depleted>───────────────────────────────┘
──────────────────────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────────────
\label{Spider's Moth Carcass, before (left) and after (right) becoming Depleted.}[figure]

\begin{example}
Cody's Spider character must pay another Hunger Cost. Cody rolls d100 against the
Moth Carcass item's 23% rating; result: 63. The Boolean Roll fails again and the Moth
Carcass Item becomes exhausted. Cody deletes the Moth Carcass from Spider's Inventory
and unticks the radio button next to it to clear the Inventory slot.
\end{example}

_Exhausted Items_ When an Inventory Item is exhausted, it can no longer be consumed to
take Actions or pay Costs. Exhausted Items are not "dropped": they just disappear
and cannot be picked up by other characters.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Consuming Food Items}

When a Food Item is consumed, the Hunger of the character consuming the Item may be
reduced.

When a character consumes a Food Item:

* Make a Consumption Roll as described in Section 2.11.6.6.

* Then make a Quantification Roll to reduce the character's Hunger rating.

  The Quantification Die for the Roll is the decile die that corresponds to the
  character's current Hunger rating. Cross-reference the character's current Hunger
  rating on Table 20 ("Quantification Dice").

The player of the character consuming the Food Item makes the Roll and changes the
character's Hunger rating.

_Beetle Consuming Food Items_ Beetle characters do not have a Hunger Feature. When a
Beetle character consumes a Food Item, their Hunger rating does not change, because they
have no Hunger rating to change.

_Effects of Consuming Food Items_ Some Food Items bestow an Effect or grant an Ability to
the consuming character. Such Items' Effects trigger as soon as an Item is consumed.
Refer to Section 2.11.5.3. for the rules of triggering Effects.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generating Food Items}

Nests & Insects Food Items are procedurally generated like everything else encountered
during a Job.

Generating a Food Item is done in two steps:

  1. Generate the Food Item's Form.

     When a Food Item is first generated, all a character knows of the Item is what it
     looks like.

     A Food Item's Form includes: a) the Item's colour; b) the Item's type; and, c) the
     amount of the Item found.

  2. Generate the Food Item's Function.

     When a Food Item is first generated, the Item is "Unknown" and a character must
     examine it, or consume it, to determine its Function.

     In general, to determine a Food Item's Function is to "Identify" the Food Item.

     When a Food Item is Identified, the following Functions are generated: a) the Item's
     Condition; b) its Alignment; and, c) its Abilities.

_Known Items_ All Items with the same Form have the same Function. Once a Food Item is
Identified it becomes a "Known" Item. Known Items are generated by simple randomisation
(i.e.  by rolling a die). The circumstances in which Known or Unknown Food Items are
generated are described in Section 3.7.3.0. Unknown Food Items are generated as Risks
while Known Food Items are generated as Rewards. Tables 25 and 26 in Section 3.7.4.0.
list the Chance to generate Food Items as Risks or Rewards during the Survival and
Exploration minigame.

The following Sections describe how to generate Food Items' Form and Function.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generating a Food Item's Form}

When an Item is first found, roll to generate the Item's Form, as follows:

1. Generate the Item's Colour.

   Roll a d12 and match the result on the Food Colour Table below.

\begin{table}[4]
d12 Result &  Food Colour
0-1        &  Black  
2-3        &  Blue
4-5        &  Green
6-7        &  Red
8-9        &  White
10-11      &  Yellow
\end{table}
\label{Food Colours}[table]

2. Generate the Item's Food Type

  Roll a d8 and match the result on the Food Type Table below.

\begin{table}[4]
d8 Result &  Food Type
0-1        &  Nectar  
2-3        &  Honey   
4-5        &  Honeydew
6-7        &  Fungus  
\end{table}
\label{Food Types}[table]

3. Quantify the amount of the Item found.

  Make a Quantification Roll to set the new Item's rating. The Quantification Die for the
  Roll is the current Nest Level's Costs/ Risks die. See Table 27 in Section 3.7.5.0. for
  Nest Levels and their Costs/ Risks dice.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Identifying Food Items}

Food Items start out as Unknown Items, whose Form is known, but whose Function is not
known. A character can identify a Food Item in one of two ways:

1. Make a Boolean Roll to identiy the Item's Function.

   The Effort for the Roll is the character's Ken or Foraging, whichever the character's
   player prefers.

   The player of the character attempting to identify an Item makes the Identification
   Roll.

   If the Roll succeeds, the GQ rolls to generate the Item's Function. The Item becomes
   Known to the character who identified it.

   Otherwise, the Item remains Unknown. The character may now only Identify the Item by
   consuming it, as described below.

   Other characters are free to attempt to Identify the Item using their Ken or Foraging
   Features.

2. Consume the Item and note its Effects.

   If the Boolean Roll to identify a Food Item's Function fails, the Item can only be
   Identified by trying it.

   Obviously, consuming an Unknown Food Item carries a risk.

   If a character consumes an Item to Identify it, generate the Item's Function as
   described in the following Section.

   Any Effects determined by a Food Item's Function trigger when the Item is consumed.

   Once all Effects caused by consuming an unknown Food Item have triggered, the Item is
   a Known Item.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generating a Food Item's Function}

When an Item is Identified in one of the two ways described in the previous Section, roll
to generate the Item's Function, as follows:

1. Generate the Item's Condition. 

   Roll a d10 and match the result on the Item Condition Table below.

\begin{table}[2]
d10 Result & Condition  & Description
0-1        & Ordinary   & Nothing special, an ordinary Item
2-3        & Blessed    & Roll to increase amount if Beneficial; decrease if Harmful
4-5        & Cursed     & Roll to increase amount if Harmful; cannot be dropped
6-7        & Spoiled    & May bestow Infected when consumed.
8-9        & Nutritious & Roll twice to decrease Hunger when consumed.
\end{table}
\label{Item Conditions}[table]

2. Generate the Item's Alignment.

    Roll a d6 and match the result on the Item Alignment Table below.

\begin{table}[4]
d6 Result &  Item Alignment
0-2       &  Beneficial
3-5       &  Harmful
\end{table}
\label{Item Alignment}[table]

3. Generate the Item's Abilities

   If the Item's Alignment is Beneficial, roll a d10 on the Beneficial Abilities table,
   below. If the Item is Harmful, roll a d10 on the Harmful Ability table instead.

\newpage

\begin{table}[4]
d10 Result&  Beneficial Ability
0         &  Healing - reduce Wounds by 1
1         &  Relief - reduce one Effect's rating to 0% (choose the Effect at random)
2         &  Restoration - reduce Wounds by 1, reduce a chosen Effect's rating to 0%
3         &  Shielding - ignore the next 1 Wound
4         &  Flight - gain Flying: d80
5         &  Armour - gain Carapace: d60
6         &  Courage - start next Combat in Advancing Disposition
7         &  Rage - start next Combat in Charging Disposition, take a Wound
8         &  Venom - gain Venomous: d60, Attacks bestow Poisoned: d60
9         &  Clarity - +d80 to next Exploration, Foraging, Hunting or Perception Roll
\end{table}
\label{Beneficial Abilities}[table]

\begin{table}[4]
d10 Result &  Harmful Ability
0          &  Agony - gain Agony
1          &  Bleeding - gain Bleeding
2          &  Blindness - gain Blind
3          &  Charming - gain Charmed
4          &  Confusion - gain Confused
5          &  Immobilisation - gain Immobilised
6          &  Infection - gain Infected
7          &  Paralysis - gain Paralysed
8          &  Poisonning - gain Poisoned
9          &  Stunning - gain Stunned
\end{table}
\label{Harmful Abilities}[table]

_Food Item Abilities_ Food Items' Abilities take effect immediately upon being consumed.
This is true for both Known and Unknown Items.

_Gaining Abilities_ When a character gains a new Ability, such as Flying or Carapace,
roll the Quantification die indicated in Table 20 to set the new Ability's rating, if the
character's rating in the Ability is 0%. Otherwise, roll that Quantification die to
increase the character's rating in the gained Ability.

_Gaining Effects_ When a character gains an Effect, such as Agony or Bleeding, if the
character has 0% rating in that Effect, roll to set the Effect's rating, otherwise roll
to increase it. The Quantification Die for the Roll is the die that corresponds to the
Item's current rating. Cross-reference the Item's rating in Table 20.

\newpage

\chapter{System}

This chapter introduces the roleplaying system used in Nests & Insects. For ease of
reference, the system is called Fuzzy d100, shortened to fd100.

fd100 is a percentile system, in the sense that it describes characters in terms of
percentile-valued Features and that the die rolled to determine the success or failure of
characters' actions is the d100, ranging from 00 to 99. Decile dice: the d20, d40, d60,
d80, d120, and the d100 itself, are used to quantify Effects and other Features on the
game's percentile scale. The d40, d60, d80, and d120 are composed of pairs of a
polyhedral die: the d4, d6, d8, and d12, respectively; and a d10, rolled together and
read as one - just as the d100 is composed of two d10 rolled together and read as one.

fd100 is designed to eliminate mental arithmetic from the process used to determine the
outcome of characters' actions ("action resolution"), and to encourage players to use
their imagination to overcome challenges faced by their characters in-game.

To determine the outcome of a character's actions, a player begins by describing the
character's Intent, then rolls a d100 and compares its result to two target numbers,
Effort and Resistance, determined by Features of the character, and enemies or the Nest
environment, respectively. The player wants to roll under Effort and equal to, or over
Resistance. The comparison determines one of four initial Degrees of Success (or Failure)
for the action: Complete Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success or Complete Success,
in order from worst to best.

Modifiers may change the Degree of Success. "Static" modifiers are compared to the
initial d100 Roll. "Dramatic" modifiers are compared each to a new d100 roll. Both types
of modifier can be positive or negative. Rolling under a positive modifier "Shifts Up"
(improves) the Degree of Success; rolling under a negative modifier "Shifts Down"
(worsens) the Degree of Success. A Shift Up changes a Complete Success to a Critical
Success and a Shift Down changes a Complete Failure to a Critical Failure.

Finally, the results of actions may need to be quantified by rolling a decile die. The
Game Queen (GQ) then describes the outcome of the action according to the character's
Intent and the Degree of Success of the action.

\newpage

\section{Decile Dice}

The die used to roll for action resolution in fd100 is the "d100". This is nominally a
hundred-sided die, but, in practice, a composite die comprised of two, ten-sided dice
(d10s), numbered 0, 1, ..., 9, which are rolled together and read as one to generate
numbers from 00 to 99.

In Nests & Insects' nomenclature, the d100 is one of five "decile dice": the d20, d40,
d60, d80, d120, and the d100 itself. The d20 is a twenty-sided die with faces numbered 0,
1, ..., 19. The d40, d60, d80, d100, and d120 are each a pair of polyhedral dice: a d4,
d6, d8, d10, and d12, respectively, numbered 0, 1, ..., n-1, where "n" is the number of
faces on the die, and used to generate the "tens" of the roll; and a d10, also numbered
0, 1, ..., 9, and used to generate the "ones" of the roll.

To generate a result in a decile die's range, the "tens" and "ones" die are rolled
together, the "tens" die is placed to the left of the "ones" die and the numbers showing
on the two dice are read left-to-right, like a printed numeral. The d20 is rolled on its
own and its results read as they come up. This way, each decile die generates numbers in
the range 00 to m-1, where "m" is the number of faces on the decile die. For example, the
d40 decile die has 40 faces and generates results in the range 00 to 39; the d60 decile
die has 60 faces and generates results in the range 00 to 59; and so on.

The d100 is the only die used to determine the Degree of Success of an Action. The other
decile dice (and the d100 itself) are used to quantify the results of Actions on the same
percentile scale as Features. This is particularly the case for Actions that bestow an
Effect on a character or another game entity.

Table 3 in the Section "Decile Dice" of the "Overview" Chapter illustrates decile dice.
The Table is reproduced here as Table 16, below, for ease of reference:

\begin{table}[4]
Decile die&  Range    &    Tens die &  Numbered   &  Ones die&  Numbered  
d20       &  0 to 19  &    Not any! &             &  d20     &  0,1,...,19
d40       &  0 to 39  &    d4       &  0,1,...,3  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d60       &  0 to 59  &    d6       &  0,1,...,5  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d80       &  0 to 79  &    d8       &  0,1,...,7  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d100      &  0 to 99  &    d10      &  0,1,...,9  &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d120      &  0 to 119 &    d12      &  0,1,...,11 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
\end{table}
\label{Decile dice, used for quantification on a percentile scale. d100 is also a}[table]
decile die, and the only one used for Action resolution. The d20 does not need a "tens"
die and is rolled on its own.
\newpage

\subsection{Implementing Decile Dice}

While the d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20 are commonly used in TTRPGs and so are easy to find,
they typically have faces numbered 1, 2, ..., n (where "n" is the number of faces of the
die). Let's call such dice "one-based". d10s typically have faces numbered 0, 1, ..., 9
(or 00, 10, ..., 90). Let's call those "zero-based". Accordingly the Nests & Insects
polyhedrals used to compose decile dice are all "zero-based", just like the typical d10.
Most roleplayers will not have zero-based polyhedral dice, other than d10s. What to do
then, to play Nests & Insects? There are four alternatives, listed below.

1. Get you a set of blank polyhedral dice and paint-in the desired numbers.

   In that case, you get a blank d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20 and paint their faces with the
   following numbers:

   d4: 0, 1, 2, 3

   d6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

   d8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

   d12: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

   d20: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

   In this case, you can keep using the standard, zero-based d10s as the "tens" for the
   d100 and the "ones" for all other decile dice. The only reason to get a blank d10 is
   to have a full set of zero-based polyhedral dice in the same style.

2. Use the standard, one-based polyhedral dice and adjust the decile die roll by
   subtraction.

   In this case, the decile d20 is a one-based, twenty-sided die with faces numbered 1,
   2, ..., 20. When you roll a one-based d20, subtract 1 from the result of the roll to
   generate numbers in the range of a zero-based d20.

   The decile d40, d60, d80, and d120 are composite dice, comprised of a one-based d4,
   d6, d8, and d12, respectively, as the "tens" of the decile die; and a zero-based d10
   as the "ones" die. To generate a decile die result, roll the "tens" and "ones" dice
   together, place the "tens" die to the left of the "ones" die, and read them
   left-to-right as before. Only this time *subtract 10 from the result* to generate a
   number in the range of the decile die. 

   The d100 doesn't change: it is comprised of two zero-based d10s read side-by-side, and
   generating numbers from 00 to 99.

3. Use the standard, one-based polyhedral dice and interpret the results as if they were
   zero-based.

   In this case, the decile d20 is a one-based, twenty-sided die with faces numbered 1,
   2, ..., 20, as in Alternative 2. When you roll the d20 as a decile die, read a "20" as
   "0". This will give you twenty numbers, from 0 to 19, as the range of the decile d20.

   As in Alternative 2, the decile d40, d60, d80, and d120 are composite dice comprised
   of a one-based d4, d6, d8, and d12, respectively, as the "tens" of the decile die; and
   a zero-based d10 as the "ones". To generate a zero-based decile die result, roll the
   "tens" and "ones" dice together, place the "tens" die to the left of the "ones" die,
   and read them left-to-right as before. Only this time, when the tens die shows its
   highest digit: "4" on a d4, "6" on a d6, "8" on a d8, and "12" on a d12, read that
   digit as "0".

   As with Alternative 2, the d100 doesn't change and is comprised of two, zero-based
   d10s read side-by-side to generate numbers from 00 to 99.

   For example, in this case, the decile d60 is comprised of a one-based d6 as the "tens"
   die and a zero-based d10 as the "ones" die. When the one-based d6 shows a "6", you
   read it as "0", so that the entire, composite d60 is zero-based. Suppose the d6 is
   showing a "6" and the d10 is showing a "5". In that case, the result of the d60 decile
   die is "05", or just "5". Suppose the d6 is showing a "6" and the d10 is showing a
   "0". In that case, the result of the d60 is "00", or just "0".

4. Use a die-rolling app.

   If you are an avid roleplayer, you probably have one of those on your phone already.

   One downside of this method is a slight risk of distraction when using one's phone in
   the middle of a game.

   Another downside is that you don't get to roll any actual dice. Some of us just like
   the physical sensation of dice clicking soothingly in the palm of the hand!

Nests & Insects' preferred decile die implementation is the one described in Alternative
1, above. Unlike the other alternatives it does not require a special way to read the
dice, as Alternative 3, and it doesn't require mental arithmetic (however simple) as
Alternative 2. Alternative 2 in particular breaks fd100's claim to "eliminate mental
arithmetic" during Action resolution! The best thing with Alternative 1, of course, is
that it makes a perfect excuse to collect even more weird gaming dice.

\newpage

\section{Six Degrees of Success and Failure}

The "Fuzzy" in the fd100 name alludes to the "fuzzy" action resolution that allows for
six Degrees of Success and Failure (DoS) as the outcome of an action. Those are listed in
Table 17, below.

\begin{table}[8]
Degree of Success &    Action outcome               &    Determined by
Critical Success  &    Satisfies Intent with reward &    Modifiers
Complete Success  &    Satisfies Intent             &    Qualification Roll
Partial Success   &    Satisfies Intent marginally  &    Qualification Roll
Partial Failure   &    Thwarts Intent marginally    &    Qualification Roll
Complete Failure  &    Thwarts Intent               &    Qualification Roll
Critical Failure  &    Thwarts Intent with penalty  &    Modifiers
\end{table}
\label{Six Degrees of Success.}[table]

The six DoS are ordered from worst (Critical Failure) to best (Critical Success) with
respect to the outcome of an Action. The exact outcome of an Action, such as rewards or
penalties on a Critical Success or Failure, depends on the Intent of the character
attempting an Action, and the context of the Action, for example whether it's taken
during a minigame in which case the outcome of the Action is defined by the rules of the
minigame. Intent is described in the "Describing Intent" Section and minigames in the
"Minigames" Section, both later in this Chapter.

Four of the DoS listed in Table 17 are determined by the result of an initial
Qualification Roll (described in the "Qualification" Section) compared to Effort and
Resistance. Two additional DoS can be achieved by the use of modifiers. Modifiers can
make the DoS indicated by the Qualification Roll better or worse, by conferring a Shift
Up or Down the DoS ordering (from worst to best, or bottom to top in Table 17).
Modifiers and DoS Shifts are described in the "Modification" Section.

\newpage

\section{Percentile Features}

\begin{box}[Rule Summaries]
Throughout this Chapter you will find text boxes summarising definitions and rules.
Rules Summary 1, below, summarises Features.
\end{box}

\begin{rules_summary}[fd100 Features]
A Feature is a game variable that describes a game entity. A Feature has a unique
identifier, its "name" and can take a value in the percentile range [1,100], its
"rating". Nests & Insects Feature names are usually single-word descriptors. A
Feature's name describes a property, ability or condition of the character. A
Feature's rating represents the chance that a character will succeed at a task or
overcome a condition described by the Feature's name. Exceptionally, the Wounds
Feature is a simple count and its rating is an integer. The ratings of Features other
than Wounds are used as the Effort and Resistance values in die rolls.
\end{rules_summary}

In fd100, game entities such as characters, enemy creatures and Rooms in Nests are
defined in terms of their "Features". Features are game variables with a unique
identifier, and a value in the percentile range from 1 to 100.

In Nests & Insects the unique identifier of a Feature is usually a single-word descriptor
that we call the Feature's "name". A Feature's percentile value is its "rating".

Features represent important properties, or abilities, of a character, something that a
character is, or can do, or a condition affecting the character.

Features' percentile ratings represent the chance that the character will successfully
carry out a task relevant to the Feature's name, or the chance that she can overcome a
condition.

The exception to percentile Feature ratings is the Wounds Feature that measures physical
injury acquired by characters usually during Combat. The value of the Wounds Feature is
always an integer, normally in the low tens, and interpreted as a simple count of the
wounds inflicted on a character.

Percentile Features' ratings are used as the Effort and Resistance values for die rolls
made to determine the outcome of characters' actions. Wounds' counts are never used as
Effort or Resistance.

Nests & Insects Features are grouped in different categories such as Attributes, Combat
Conditions, Effects, etc. The "Character Sheet" chapter briefly describes the different
categories of character Features. Complete descriptions of the Features of characters and
enemies, and their use in the game, are given in the Chapters "Character", and "Setting".

\section{Taking Actions}

\subsection{Action resolution steps}

Players' characters can take actions to achieve their goals within the context of
minigames, and without. Actions are resolved in up to eight steps, summarised below and
discussed in detail in the following sections.

\begin{rules_summary}[Action Resolution]

1. Intent: Describe the character's intent.

2. Effort and Resistance: Decide which Features to use as Effort and Resistance.

3. Qualification: Roll a d100 and compare it to Effort and Resistance.

4. Degree of Success: Determine the Degree of Success or Failure (DoS) of the Action.

5. Modification: Apply modifiers. The DoS may Shift up or Down and become Critical.

7. Quantification: Roll a decile die to quantify the results of the Action.

8. Resolution: Describe the outcome of the Action.

\end{rules_summary}

Not all of the above steps are necessary to resolve all Actions. For instance, some
Actions may require Quantification, but others may not; modifiers may apply to some
Actions but not others; etc.

_Terminology_ gaming terms like "Qualification", "Modification", "Degree of Success" and
so on are used for easy reference to important game concepts. You do not have to learn
them by heart.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Describing Intent}

\begin{rules_summary}[Intent]
An Action begins with a description of the character's Intent. The description must
be sufficiently detailed to help determine the Features to be used as Effort and
Resistance, or modifiers, for the Action. Minigame rules define the Intent of
formulaic minigame Actions and the Features to use as Effort, Resistance and
modifiers for such Actions.
\end{rules_summary}

A player begins resolving a character's Action by describing the character's Intent: why
or how the character is acting, what she hopes to achieve. This description can be as
elaborate or simple as the character, and the player group, feel like.

The only requirement is that the description of the character's Intent is sufficiently
detailed for the GQ to be able to determine the Features to be used as Effort and
Resistance, or modifiers.

\begin{example}
Brody declares his character's intent: "Spider attacks the second Nasute Soldier".
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Cody declares his character's intent: "I want Wasp to display her stripes and scare
the living beejeesus out of the Worker Bees! I want her to dive in towards them,
buzzing menacingly and waving her abdomen around in, like, a threatening and
provocative manner! I want them to run away screaming from buzzing, venomous DEATH!
BzzZZZzzZZZZzz!"
\end{example}

Both styles illustrated in Examples 1 and 2 are fine, as far as the game rules are
concerned. It doesn't matter that Bees cannot scream and won't run away.

In Example 6 it is clear that Brody's character is attacking. His character is acting
either during Combat, or just before Combat begins, so the Effort and Resistance should
be Spider's Threat Rate and the Nasute Soldier's Survival Rate, as determined by the
Combat minigame.

In Example 7, Cody is clearly describing the use of Wasp's Flying and Signalling to
perform an aggressive display with the purpose of scaring the Worker Bees. Effort is
Wasp's Signalling and Resistance is most likely the Bees' Passions. Wasp's Flying can be
used as a static modifier, or as a dramatic modifier, or ignored.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Effort and Resistance}

Effort and Resistance are the two target numbers for the Qualification Roll that
determines the initial DoS of an Action.

\begin{rules_summary}[Effort]
Effort represents the character's effort to achieve her Intent, as described by the
player. The value of Effort is equal to one of the acting character's Features that
is most appropriate for the attempted Action, according to the Feature's name.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Resistance]
Resistance represents the resistance of game entities to the character's Action. The
value of Resistance is equal to an appropriate Feature of an enemy creature, or of
the Nest's environment, or any game entity opposing the character's Intent.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Choosing Effort and Resistance]
The description of the character's Intent informs the selection of Features used as
Effort and Resistance. Minigame rules define the Features to use as Effort and
Resistance for formulaic minigame Actions with predefined Intent.
\end{rules_summary}

_Minigame Actions_ If the Action is taking place during a minigame, and it is one of the
minigame's formulaic Actions, the minigame rules will define a formula that determines
Effort and Resistance Features.

_Other Actions_ If the Action is taking place outwith a minigame, or a minigame does not
define a formula for the attempted Action, the player and the GQ together decide what
Features are best used as Effort and Resistance. Use Features' names and descriptions
and apply gaming sense. Usually, the GQ will suggest a relevant pair of Features. The
player is free to negotiate a different pair but the GQ has the final word. Any
negotiation should not take as long as to bore the rest of the group.

\begin{example}
Brody negotiates with the GQ: "But Wasp is Venomous so she can display her Stinger
and maximise the intimidation of the Minor Termite Soldiers".
\end{example}

In Example 8 Brody is negotiating the use of Wasp's Venomous: 80% Specific Abiliy as
Effort to an Action with intent to intimidate some Termite Soldiers. Normally, an Action
with this Intent would use a character's Signalling Feature as Effort. Wasp's Signalling
is 68% which is already pretty good, but Brody wants to maximise the chance to intimidate
the Termites. It's up to the GQ whether to accept this or not. If the GQ decides that
Signalling is the appropriate Feature to use as Effort, so it is.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Qualification}

\begin{rules_summary}[Qualification Roll]
To make a Qualification Roll means to roll a d100 and compare it to Effort and
Resistance, simultaneously. To roll under Effort is to achieve or "match" Effort. To
roll over, or equal to, Resistance is to overcome, or "beat" Resistance.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Degree of Success and Failure]
If the Qualification Roll matches Effort, then the DoS of the Action is a "Success";
otherwise, it is a "Failure". If the Qualification Roll beats Resistance, then the
DoS of the Action is a "Complete" Success, or a "Partial" Failure; otherwise it is a
Complete Failure, or a Partial Success.
\end{rules_summary}

Once Effort and Resistance are chosen the player rolls a d100 and compares its result to
Effort and Resistance. This is called a "Qualification Roll". To achieve the best outcome
in a Qualification Roll the player wants to roll under Effort, and over or equal to
Resistance. The former is to "match" Effort and the latter is to "beat" Resistance.

The result of the d100 roll relative to Effort and Resistance determines four initial
Degrees of Success or Failure: Complete Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success or
Complete Success, in order from worst to best for the purpose of satisfying the
character's Intent. The four initial Degrees of Success and Failure are summarised in
Table 18 below.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Effort&       Roll beats Resistance&       Degree of Success
True               &       True                 &       Complete Success
True               &       False                &       Partial Success
False              &       True                 &       Partial Failure
False              &       False                &       Complete Failure
\end{table}
\label{Degree of Success.}[table]

_Possible Degrees of Success_ Not all Degrees of Success and Failure are possible to
achieve just with a Qualification Roll. If Effort is lower than or equal to Resistance,
Complete Success is not possible. If Effort is higher than Resistance, Complete Failure
is not possible. All six DoS, including Critical Success and Critical Failure are only
achievable through the use of modifiers, described in the "Modification" Section,
following.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Modification}

\begin{rules_summary}[Static and Dramatic Modifiers]
Modifiers change the DoS of an Action. There are two types of modifiers: static and
dramatic. Static modifiers are compared to the d100 result of the Qualification roll.
For each dramatic modifier a new d100 roll is made and the dramatic modifier compared
to the result of the roll.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Positive and Negative Modifiers]
Modifiers can be positive or negative. Matching a positive modifier confers a Shift
Up to the DoS. Failiing to beat a negative modifier confers a Shift Down to the DoS.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Shifts Up and Shifts Down]
A Shift Up changes the DoS from worse to better. A Shift Down changes the DoS from
better to worse. A Shift Up from Complete Success changes the DoS to Critical
Success. A Shift Down from Complete Failure changes the DoS to Critical Failure.
\end{rules_summary}

Modifiers are Features of a character or game entities that further support or hinder the
character's Actions, in addition to Effort and Resistance. Like Effort and Resistance,
what modifiers apply to an Action depends on the character's Intent, as described by the
player or defined by a minigame formula.

There are two types of modifiers: static modifiers and dramatic modifiers. Both can be
either positive or negative. Static modifiers are compared to the d100 result of the
Qualification Roll. Dramatic modifiers are each compared to a new d100 roll.

In mechanical terms, modifiers confer Shifts Up or Down to the DoS of an Action, after it
is determined by an initial Qualification Roll. A Shift moves the DoS up or down, from
worst to best. The Changes to DoS by the use of modifiers are summarised in Table 19
below.

\begin{table}[8]
d100 Roll...    &       Modifier Sign&       Change to DoS
Matches Modifier&       Positive     &       Shift Up
Beats Modifier  &       Positive     &       No change
Matches Modifier&       Negative     &       Shift Down
Beats Modifier  &       Negative     &       No change
\end{table}
\label{Modifiers and change to DoS.}[table]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Choosing modifiers}

\begin{rules_summary}[The Rule of Two]
At most two dramatic modifiers may be applied to a single Action: either a) two
positive, or b) two negative, or c) one positive and one negative.
\end{rules_summary}

Static modifiers model routine complications to ordinary Actions, in particular minigame
Actions. Dramatic modifiers model uncommon or surprising variation to Actions. 

Static modifiers are usually defined by minigame formulae. Dramatic modifiers might be
proposed by a player and are ultimately granted by the GQ. The GQ should grant a dramatic
modifier when a character takes an Action that is high-stakes, spectacular, or
unexpected, or impresses and surprises the group in some other way. In other words:
dramatic modifiers should apply when it is dramatically appropriate to take additional
information into account that might change the course of the game.

No more than two dramatic modifiers may be applied to a single Action: either two
positive or two negative, or one of each sign. This is in the interest of reducing the
number of rolls needed to resolve an Action. Static modifiers are compared to the result
of the Qualification roll, and do not need a separate roll, therefore there is no
restriction to the number of static modifiers that can apply to an Action.

Dramatic modifiers should be used sparingly, in special circumstances. As a rough rule of
thumb, the GQ should grant no more than two or three dramatic modifiers per game session.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Quantification}

\begin{rules_summary}[Quantification Roll]
To make a Quantification Roll means to roll a decile die and change the rating of a
Feature according to the result. There are three types of Quantification Roll: a Roll
to Set, a Roll to Increase, and a Roll to Decrease, the value of a Feature.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Roll to Set]
To make a Quantification Roll to set the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die and
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Roll to Increase]
To make a Quantification Roll to increase the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die
and compare it to the rating of the Feature. If the result of the roll is higher,
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{rules_summary}

\begin{rules_summary}[Roll to Decrease]
To make a Quantification Roll to decrease the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die
and compare it to the rating of the Feature. If the result of the roll is lower,
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{rules_summary}

A Quantification Roll is made to quantify the results of an Action. Invariably, the
Quantification Roll sets, or modifies, the rating of a Feature of a character, an enemy,
or the Nest environment. The rating of the Feature is directly set to the value of the
Quantification Roll, without addition or subtraction, as summarised in Rules Summaries
13-16.

If the results of an Action need to be quantified, this will be explicitly stated in the
rules: either the rules of a minigame, or the description of a Feature. The GQ may also
decide that an Action needs quantification.

A Quantification Roll is only made after the Modification step of Action resolution, when
the final DoS of an Action is known. This is because the decile die to roll may depend on
the DoS of the Action.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Choosing a Quantification Die}

\begin{rules_summary}[Quantification Die]
The decile die rolled to Quantify a Feature depends on the current rating of the
Feature, or the rating of the Effort for an Action requiring Quantification.
\end{rules_summary}

A rule asking for a Quantification Roll may specify the decile die to be rolled.
Otherwise, the decile die to roll is determined by the current rating of a "Quantified
Feature" which is either:

* the Feature to be Quantified, if the Quantification Roll is to increase or decrease, or

* the Effort for the Action that resulted in the Feature's Quantification if the
  Quantification Roll is to set.

When a rule asks for a Quantification Roll and does not specify the decile die to roll,
consult Table 20 below to determine the decile die for the Quantification Roll.

\begin{table}[4]
Quantified Feature Rating &   Quantification Die
01-20%                    &   d40
21-40%                    &   d60
41-60%                    &   d80
61-80%                    &   d100
81-100%                   &   d120
\end{table}
\label{Quantification Dice.}[table]

_d120 Quantification Die_ When the d120 is rolled for Quantification its effective range
is "capped" at 100. That is to say, a Feature's rating can never exceed 100, even if the
d120 is used to quantify the Feature's rating, and the result rolled is higher than 100.
The d120 is only used to (slightly) increase the chances to roll high, and so increase
the rating of a Feature that is already close to 100%.

\begin{example}
Cody's Ants character acquires a new Bleeding Effect bestowed by an Attack with a
Threat Rate of 45%. The Bleeding Effect must be set, thus the Attack's Threat Rate is
the Quantified Feature. The Quantification Die corresponding to 45% in Table 20 is
the d60. The GQ rolls a d60: 13%. Cody sets the Ants' Bleeding to 13%.

Later, the Ants' Bleeding must increase to pay an Effects Cost (Section 3.7.4.0).
The Quantified Feature is now the Bleeding Effect. The Quantification Die
corresponding to the current Bleeding rating of 13% in Table 20 is the d40. The GQ
rolls d40: 32%. Cody sets the Ants' Bleeding to 32%.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Resolution}

\begin{rules_summary}[Outcome description]
The outcome of Actions is described by the GQ.
\end{rules_summary}

Once the Qualification roll is made, the final DoS of the Action is known, Action results
are Quantified and Features' ratings are changed as necessary, the GQ describes the
outcome of the Action.

_The role of the GQ_ The GQ's responsibility is to be the eyes and ears of the players in
the game world and the only interface between the players and their characters. Only what
the GQ describes, actually happens in the game world. In that sense, the role of the GQ
is that of a benevolent dictator: she has absolute authority over the game world, but she
must ensure that the game is worthwhile for the entire group.

\newpage

\subsection{Simplified Rolls}

\subsubsection{Boolean Roll}

\begin{rules_summary}[Boolean Roll]
To make a Boolean Roll describe the character's Intent and choose Effort as for a
Qualification Roll, then roll d100 and compare the result to Effort. If the result of
the d100 roll matches Effort, the attempted Action Succeeds. Otherwise, it Fails.
\end{rules_summary}

A Boolean Roll is a simpler form of the Qualification Roll that only determines Success
or Failure, without any finer gradation. Only an Effort value need be chosen to make
a Boolean roll- neither Resistance, nor modifiers are taken into account.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Feature&        Action Outcome
True                &        Success       
False               &        Failure       
\end{table}
\label{Boolean Roll.}[table]

A Boolean Roll may be called for by the rules of minigames. For example, the Combat
minigame calls for a Boolean Roll to determine a character's starting Disposition at the
start of Combat, or to resist an Effect for a Turn.

The GQ may also call for a Boolean Roll when the complexity of determining the full Six
Degrees of Success and Failure of a Qualification Roll with modifiers is not justified by
the context of the Action, or when it is not clear from the context of an Action what the
difference is between different DoS.

\begin{example}
Brody's Beetle is trying to lift a piece of debris from the Nest's floor. This is a
simple Action that can either succeed or fail. The GQ asks for a Boolean Roll against
Beetle's Strength: 55%. Brody rolls: 78. The result does not match Beetle's Strength
so Beetle fails to lift the piece of debris from the floor.
\end{example}

\begin{note}
In percentile systems the Boolean Roll is more often known as as a "Skill Check" or
"Test". Nests & Insects calls it a "Boolean Roll" to distinguish its crisp, binary
determination of success and Failure from the "fuzzy" one of the Qualification Roll.
Unfortunately, the alternative "Crisp Roll" was not thematically appropriate.
\end{note}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Contested Boolean Roll}

\begin{rules_summary}[Contested Boolean Roll]
To make a Contested Boolean Roll describe the character's Intent and choose Effort
and Resistance as for a Qualification Roll, then roll d100 and compare the result to
Effort and Resistance simultaneously. If the result of the d100 roll matches Effort
and beats Resistance, the attempted Action Succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.
\end{rules_summary}

A Contested Boolean Roll is a Boolean Roll that also takes into account the Resistance of
a game entity to a character's Effort, but like the ordinary Boolean Roll, only
determines Success or Failure, without any degrees thereof.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Effort &   Roll beats Resistance &   Action Outcome
True                &   True                  &   Success       
True                &   False                 &   Failure
False               &   True                  &   Failure      
False               &   False                 &   Failure       
\end{table}
\label{Contested Boolean Roll.}[table]

Unlike the Boolean Roll, the Contested Boolean Roll is not called for by any minigames.
It's up to the GQ to decide when a Contested Boolean Roll is the preferred option. The
main use of the Contested Boolean Roll is to simplify the resolution of Actions where
it makes sense to take into account the Resistance to a character's Effort, but where the
full complexity of the Six Degrees of Success of the Qualification Roll is not needed.

\begin{example}
Cody's Beetle is trying to lift a piece of debris from the Nest's floor. The GQ asks
the Beetle player for a Contested Boolean Roll. Effort is Beetle's Strength: 55%, and
Resistance is 45%, because the GQ determines the piece of debris is not too heavy.
Cody rolls: 15. That matches Beetle's Effort but does not beat Resistance. The Action
outcome is a Failure and Beetle cannot lift the debris.
\end{example}

\begin{note}
The outcome of a Contested Boolean Roll can only be Success when Effort is higher
than Resistance. When Resistance is equal to, or higher than Effort, the Action can
only fail. In that case, either don't make any rolls at all, or make a full
Qualification Roll or a simple Boolean Roll instead.
\end{note}

\section{Minigames}

Nests & Insects is organised around four "minigames". A minigame is a set of special
rules for a special game situation that Nests & Insects wants to model with more detail
than the standard fd100 rules. Combat is the most detailed and elaborate of Nests &
Insects' minigames. The other three are Survival and Exploration; Hunting and Foraging;
and Resting and Healing. Brief descriptions are listed below.

* The Combat minigame defines rules for, well, combat between the players' characters and
  a Nest's denizens.

* The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for characters to explore, and the
  GQ to roll the dice to procedurally generate, a Nest.

* The Hunting and Foraging minigame defines rules for finding sustenance and medicinal
  Food items.

* The Resting and Healing minigame defines rules for healing from wounds and Effects,
  consuming food Items to reduce Hunger, and using XP to improve characters' Features.

\newpage

\subsection{Minigame Formulaic Actions}

Each minigame is characterised by a set of standard Actions that characters typically
take during the circumstances modelled by the minigame. For example, during Combat,
characters typically attack enemies. Such Actions are a minigame's "formulaic" Actions.

Minigames define each of their formulaic Actions by means of a Formula that includes at
least a listing of Effort, Resistance and modifier Features and a table listing the
outcome of a formulaic Action for each DoS of a Qualification Roll. The Minigame Formula
Template figure below illustrates the template used to define minigame formulae.

Name of the Minigame: ............... (The minigame that defines this formula)
Participating Entities: ............. (Characters, enemies or other game entities)
List of Minigame Intents: ........... (Pre-determined character Intents)
List of Minigame Actions: ........... (Formulaic minigame Actions)
Effort Variables: ................... (The names of Features used as Effort)
Resistance Variables: ............... (The names of Features used as Resistance)
Modifier Variables: ................. (The names of Features used as static modifiers)

Outcomes of the six Degrees of Success and Failure:

\begin{table}[12]

\newpage

\section{Combat}

\subsection{Combat Summary}

Combat begins when the characters and a group of enemies attack one another. Combat is
divided into Rounds, divided into Turns in which characters and enemies participating in
Combat (Combatants) get to act, and players and the GQ roll dice to decide the outcome of
Combatants' Actions.

At the start of Combat, before the first Round, Combatants' starting Disposition and
Initiative Order are decided, then the first Round begins and Combatants take Turns in
order of their Initiative. Combatants can take Actions out of Turn for example to
Suppress an enemy or Support an ally, or Resist an Effect.

Players decide their characters' Actions and the GQ decides the actions of enemies.

The goal of Combat Actions is to inflict Wounds or bestow detrimental Effects on enemies
in order to kill them, or reduce their effectiveness in Combat, or reduce their
Disposition until they are Retreating.

Wounds cause the DoS of all subsequent Combat Actions to Shift Down. Reduced Disposition
similarly imposes negative modifiers to subsequent Actions. Once a character or enemy's
Disposition reaches Retreating the Combatant cannot take Actions other than fleeing form
Combat. If a Combatant's Wounds reach or exceed the maximum marked on her sheet, the
Combatant is killed.

Combat ends when all Combatants on one side are either killed, or Retreating.

\newpage

\subsection{Combat Steps}

The Combat minigame plays out in nine Steps, two of which repeat until Combat ends. The
nine Combat Steps are summarised in Rules Summary 20, below, and discussed in detail in
the following Sections.

\begin{rules_summary}[Combat Steps]

1. Determine Combat participants (Combatants) and the Sides they fight on.

2. Determine all Combatants' starting Disposition.

3. Determine Combatants' Initiative Order.

4. A new Combat Round begins.

5. A new Combat Turn begins.

6. The next Combatant in the Initiative Order takes a Turn.

7. Repeat from Step 5 until all Combatants have taken a Turn, or passed.

8. Repeat from Step 4 until all Combatants on one side of Combat are killed, or
   Retreating.

9. Combat Ends.

\end{rules_summary}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Determine Combatants and Sides}

Combat begins when either the characters, or Nest creatures attack one another. 

All characters in the Room where Combat is taking place make up one Side of Combat.

All creatures of the same species as the creature attacking or attacked by the characters
and in the same Room as that creature make up the other Side of Combat.

Characters or creatures on the same Side are "allies" and those on the opposite Side are
"enemies".

All the creatures on the two Sides of Combat are Combatants for the duration of Combat.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Starting Disposition}

Before the start of the first Combat Round each player makes a Boolean Roll against their
character's Initiative, and the GQ similarly makes a Boolean Roll against Initiative for
each of the enemies. Each Combatant whose Initiative roll is Successful starts Combat in
Holding Disposition. Each Combatant whose Initiative roll is Failed, starts Combat in
Recoiling Disposition.

\begin{table}[8]
Initiative Roll Result &    Starting Disposition
Success                &    Holding
Failure                &    Recoiling
\end{table}
\label{Starting Disposition.}[table]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Initiative Order}

Before the start of the first Combat Round and after Starting Disposition is determined,
the GQ decides the Initiative Order for all Combatants.

Combatants take Turns in order of their Initiative. The Combatant with the highest
Initiative Order takes the first Turn, the one with the next highest Initiative Order
takes the second Turn, and so on.

Initiative Order is determined as follows:

* For each Combatant, their Initiative Order is equal to their Initiative rating.

* If two Combatants are tied for Initiative, the Combatant with the most advanced
  Disposition (closest to Charging) takes a Turn before the other Combatants.

* If two or more Combatants are still tied after Initiative and Disposition are compared,
  the GQ rolls a die or flips a coin to break the tie.

The die to roll to break ties depends on the number of Combatants tied for Initiative: if
there are two Combatants tied, flip a coin. If there are three, roll a d6 divided by two.
If there are four, roll a d4. And so on.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Combat Rounds}

Once Initiative Order is determined the first Round of Combat begins and Combatants take
Actions in Turn, in order of Initiative.

Combatants can take up to three Actions per Round: 

* one Tactical Action which can be an Attack, Suppress or Support Action;

* one Resist Action; 

* and one Manoeuver Action. 

Characters can pass the chance to take any or all of their three Actions, or take one or
two additional Manoeuver Actions in place of their other two Actions.

_Acting out of Turn_ Combatants can forfeit their Turn to take a Tactical Action in an
ally or opponent's Turn. The timing of Actions in a Round is clarified below.

During a combat Round a Combatant can:

* In her Turn, take an Attack Action targeting an enemy.

* In her Turn, take a Suppress Action targeting an enemy.

* In an ally's Turn, take a Support Action targeting that ally.

* In any Turn, before taking another Action, take a Resist Action targeting one Effect
  she is subject to.

* In her Turn, take a Manoeuver Action.

/*
_Deferring a Turn_ Combatants can delay their Actions to a Turn in the Round after their
own in the Turn Order. The player declares that her character is deferring her Turn, or
"waiting" or something similar. Later in the Round, when it is the Turn of another
character or enemy the player can declare that her character will now take her deferred
Turn. Her character then takes a Turn and the character whose Turn it was originally
takes the Turn after that. 
*/

\newpage

\subsubsection{Attack Action}

In her Turn, a Combatant can take one Attack Action targeting an enemy with her Base or
Special Attack. The DoS of the Attack determines which Attack Hits or Misses.

To determine the outcome of an Attack make a Qualification Roll with Effort equal to the
Attacker's Threat Rate and Resistance equal to the target's Survival Rate. If the target
has nonzero Flying or Carapace, they are used as static modifiers to the Roll.

Following is the Combat minigame formula for the Attack Action.

Name of the Minigame ................ Combat
Participating Entities .............. Characters, Enemies
List of Minigame Intents ............ Kill, Hurt, Injure, Rout
List of Minigame Actions ............ Attack
Effort Variables .................... Threat Rate
Resistance Variables ................ Survival Rate
Modifier Variables .................. Carapace, Flying

Outcomes of the six Degrees of Success and Failure:

\begin{table}[12]
Degree of Success &    Outcome
Critical Success  &    Base and Special Attacks Hit
Complete Success  &    Special Attack Hits
Partial Success   &    Base Attack Hits
Partial Failure   &    Base Attack Misses
Complete Failure  &    Special Attack Misses
Critical Failure  &    Base and Special Attacks Miss
\end{table}

_Carapace_ If an Attack has keywords Crushing, Piercing or Shredding and the target has
Carapace > 0%, the target's Carapace rating is a negative static modifier to the Attack
Roll.

_Flying_ If the target of an Attack has Flying > 0%, the target's Flying rating is a
negative, static modifier to the Attack Roll. Additionally, Close range Attacks can only
target a Combatant with Flying > 0% if the attacker also has Flying > 0%. 

_Targeting allies_ Spider's Base and Special Attacks have an Alternative Hit result that
can heal, or remove Bleeding from an ally. Spider can target an ally with her Attack.

% Explain what happens when an Attack hits or misses: damage, disposition, etc. 
\newpage

\subsubsection{Suppress Action}

In an enemy's Turn, a Combatant can take the following Suppress Actions:

1. Attempt to confuse an enemy: roll Smarts vs. Ken to bestow a Confused Effect.

2. Attempt to charm an enemy: roll Charms vs. Passions to bestow a Charmed Effect.

   Down.

\subsubsection{Support Action}

In an ally's Turn, a Combatant can take the following Support Actions.

1. Attempt to rally the ally, if the ally is Retreating: roll Leadership vs. Passions.

2. Attempt to encouarge the ally to improve her Disposition: roll Leadership vs.
   Passions. The ally must not be Retreating.

3. Attempt to focus a Confused ally's mind: roll Smarts vs. the ally's Confused.
 
4. Attempt to snap a Charmed ally out of it: roll Charms vs the ally's Charmed.

Following is the Combat minigame Formula for the Support Action.

\end{table}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Manoeuver Action}

Manoeuver Actions provide a mechanism for players' characters and enemies controlled by
the GQ to take improvised actions, outside of the formulaic Actions of the Combat
minigame. For this reason there are no special rules for Manoeuver Actions and no
minigame formula for them. The GQ must come up with special rules on the fly.

To take a Manoeuver Action, describe the Combatant's Intent, then choose Effort and
Resistance, and resolve the Action with a Qualification Roll, a Boolean Roll, or a
Contested Boolean Roll, as described in Chapter "fd100". Feel free to add a
Quantification Roll and bestow an Effect as a result of a Manoeuver. Any of a Combatant's
Features can be used to take a Manoeuver Action. Below are some example Manoeuvers:

* Lift an enemy off the ground and throw her behind her allies' lines: roll Strength vs.
  the enemy's Stamina. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy loses one Turn of combat.

* Lift an enemy off the ground, carry her, flying, behind her allies lines and drop her
  there: Roll Flying + Strength vs. the enemy's Stamina. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy
  acquires Stunned: d40.

* Direct an ally to hit an enemy where she has been previously wounded: Roll Ken +
  Signalling vs. the enemy's Smarts. If the Action succeeds, the ally gets a positive
  static modifier to her next Attack. Roll d40 to Quantify the modifier.

* Give an enemy the old run-around: Roll Speed vs. Speed to evade an enemy taking an
  Attack Action targeting the character. If the Roll Succeeds, the enemy's Turn is
  postponed until the end of the Round.

* Bash together a barrier to protect the character and her allies: Make a Boolean Roll
  vs. Construction or Web Weaving. If the Roll succeeds, the character and one ally can
  take cover behind the barrier, and the next Ranged Attack targeting them has a -30%
  static negative modifier. After an Attack targets the characters behind the barrier,
  the barrier is destroyed.

\begin{box}[Houseruling Manoeuvers]
Manoeuvers are an opportunity for players to use their imagination to come up with
creative ways to gain an advantage in Combat, or for the GQ to use hers to create
interesting and challenging situations for the players to overcome. A character's
Intent, as described by her player, should guide the GQ to "houserule" the
character's Actions. Accordingly the GQ should not hesitate to play the Nest's
guardians as more than dumb automata, who can also use their (simple) insectoid
brains to protect their home.
\end{box}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Breaking from Combat}

A Combatant can Break from (leave) Combat at any time, as a Manoeuver Action. This is the
only Manoeuver Action that gets its own rule.

To have a Combatant Break from Combat, make a Boolean Roll with the character's
Initiative as Effort. If the Roll succeeds, the character or enemy is no longer in Combat
and can take Actions other than formulaic Combat Actions, as usual. If the Roll fails,
the Combatant remains a Combatant. She is free to try again in her next Turn.

\subsubsection{Consuming Food in Combat}

There is no formulaic Combat Action that allows a Combatant to consume a Food item during
Combat. War is no picnic! Combatants are also not allowed to consume Food as a Manoeuver!

If a player or the GQ wishes a character or enemy to consume a Food Item, the Combatant
must first Break from Combat.

\subsubsection{Joining Combat}

A creature who is not in Combat can always Join Combat. The creature may have Broken from
Combat previously, or she may not have been in the same Room as her friends when Combat
began. It doesn't really matter: a creature can always join Combat.

Joining Combat requires no roll. A creature who is not a Combatant joins Combat at the
start of the next Combat Round, after a player or the GQ declares that the character or
enemy is joining Combat. At the start of that Round, before any Combatants' Turn,
determine the new Combatant's Disposition and Initiative Order, then she takes her first
Turn in Initiative Order, as normal.

\begin{note}
A common reason for new Combatants to join Combat is when the Nest's Guardians summon
their conspecifics to help them repell the intruders. In that case, when the summoned
allies arrive, they Join Combat as described above.
\end{note}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Combat Ends}

When Combat ends, all Combatants cease to be Combatants and the two Sides cease to
exist for rules purposes.

Nothing else worthy of note happens at the end of Combat. 

\newpage

\section{Survival and Exploration}

The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for the procedural generation of a
Nest's environment. During the Survival and Exploration minigame, characters explore the
Nest, while players and the GQ roll dice to determine what the characters find.

\begin{note}
Procedural Generation also takes place during the Hunting and Foraging minigame.
However, in order for Hunting and Foraging to be initiated, the characters must first
explore the Nest by means of the Survival and Exploration minigame.
\end{note}

In Nests & Insects procedural generation is an abstraction: no floor plans or maps are
generated. Instead what is generated are the Features of game entities, including the
spaces inside the Nests, the creatures that roam them, and items that populate them.

\newpage

\subsection{How Procedural Generation Works}

The core mechanic of procedural generation is "rolling on tables". No, that is not to be
taken literally. It means that the players or the GQ roll a d100 and cross-reference the
result with the rows of a table. The table lists what the characters find and what
happens to them while they explore the Nest.

_Exploration Action_ Survival and Exploration starts with an Exploration Action. This
Action is resolved by a full Qualification Roll and its outcome determines the types, and
numbers, of Events that occur as the characters explore the Nest. There are three types
of Events: Costs, Risks and Rewards. Any Exploration Action may cause up to three Events
to occur. A better DoS to the Exploration Action causes more Rewards to occur while a
worse one causes more Costs and Risks to occur.

_Rolling for Events_ Once the type and number of Events is determined, the players roll
on the relevant Event tables (i.e. the Costs, Risks, or Rewards tables) to find which
specific Events occur. This roll is a Boolean Roll, where the target number is the Chance
for an Event to occur (it doesn't make sense to call this target number an "Effort" as in
ordinary Boolean Rolls). For each Exploration Action a single Boolean Roll is made and
its result looked up on each relevant Event table in turn. Each Event whose Chance is
matched by the Boolean Roll is "generated" (i.e. occurs). Thus, multiple Events may occur
as a result of a single Exploration Action. Some Events may also require a Quantification
roll to quantify their Features.

_Chance of Events_ The Chance for an Event to occur is determined by two values, summed:
one is a base Chance listed in the corresponding Event table; the other is the rating of
the Nest Level on which the characters are currently located. In some cases a Feature of
the exploring Character may be used as the base Chance for an Event to occur. Nest Levels
closer to a Job's target have a higher rating thus causing the Exploration Action to fail
more often and causing more Costs and Risks to occur. Nest Levels also define the decile
dice to roll for Quantification of the three kinds of Events and their Features.

Events are listed in Tables 24-26, in Section 3.7.4.0. Nest Level ratings and their
Quantification Dice are listed in Table 27, in Section 3.7.5.0. 

\newpage

\subsection{The Nest environment}

A Nest is an environment that consists of multiple Nest Levels, each comprised of
multiple Rooms, as well as Passages, Shortcuts and Shafts connecting Rooms between them,
and connecting a Level to other Levels.

Levels, Rooms, Shortcuts and Shafts are all generated as Events during the Survival and
Exploration minigame. They are collectively known as Nest Environment Events, or, more
simply, Environments.

In mechanical terms, Environments act as resources that can be "spent" to initiate
minigames, or to pay Costs. In particular, in order to initiate the Survival and
Exploration minigame itself, a Room must be spent. The characters always start the game
with one Room: the Entrance to the Nest.

\subsubsection{Nest Levels}

A Nest Level is a group of Rooms connected to each other by Passages and connected by
Shortcuts and Shafts to different Levels. Rooms in the same Level are situated at about
the same distance from the ground, much like a floor in a multi-storey house. 

In mechanical terms, Levels have a percentile rating that is used as the Resistance to
Exploration Actions. As the characters delve deeper into the Nest, the Nest Level of the
Rooms they visit increases. With it, the chance for Cost and Risk Events to occur
increases, and the chance for Reward Events to occur decreases. When the Nest Level
reaches 100% the location of the target of the current Job is found and the characters
can attempt to fulfill the terms of their contract.

\begin{note}
Remember that the players' characters do not visit a Nest to loot. Rather, they are
hired to carry out a Job. Accordingly, Rewards they find during Exploration are not
treasures and richess, rather they are things that help the characters get their Job
done.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Rooms}

A Room is an enclosed area within a Level. In truth, eusocial insects' nests don't
ordinarily have many distinct rooms and are mainly composed of tunnels (with the
exception of bees' and eusocial wasps' nests that are entirely composed of hexagonal
cells, i.e. "rooms" of a sort). Despite this and for the sake of playing the game, Nests
& Insects pretends that Nests have Rooms.

Room Events are Rewards and are only generated (i.e. found) when a character takes an
Exploration Action. 

Rooms have Features such as their Area, Height, or Darkness, that require Quantification.
Room Features are only quantified when characters must interact with them. For example,
Height affects the ability of a character to Fly, so it is only Quantified when a
character actually attempts to Fly, or takes another Action that requires the height of a
Room to be known.

\subsubsection{Passages}

A Passage is a tunnel, or a simple opening, or some other kind of entryway connecting two
Rooms in the same Level.

In mechanical terms, a Passage is a Cost Event that can be spent to grant a chance to
find a Room.

\subsubsection{Shafts}

A Shaft is a tunnel heading downwards, or upwards, towards the location of the target of
the current Job. As passages connect Rooms, Shafts connect Levels. 

In mechanical terms, a Shaft is a Reward Event that can be spent to grant a chance to
find a new Level with an increased Level rating, thus bringing characters closer to their
Job's target.

\subsubsection{Shortcuts}

A Shortcut is a tunnel connecting the current Level with a Level closer to the center of
the Nest.

In mechanical terms, a Shortcut is a Reward Event that can be spent to grant a chance to
immediately find the Level with rating 100%, where the target of the current Job is
situated.
\newpage

\subsection{Event Generation}

Costs, Risks, and Rewards are generated every time a character takes an Exploration
Action. The Qualification Roll for the Exploration Action sets the number and type of
Events that occur during the Action. Then the players or the GQ roll to generate Events
of the indicated types.

To generate Events, the players or the GQ make a Boolean Roll and reference the result on
the appropriate Event tables, Tables 24-26 in the following Section. 

If Events of multiple types (Costs, Risks and Rewards) must be generated, a single
Boolean Roll is made and its result referenced on all relevant tables.

Each Event table has a "Chance" column, listing the Chance for each Event to occur, as a
percentile rating. This Chance rating is used as the "Effort" of the Boolean Roll to
generate Events. When the result of the Boolean Roll is referenced on an Event table, all
Events in that table with a Chance matched by the result of the Roll are generated.

If multiple Events of the same kind (Cost, Risk or Reward) are generated by the same
Boolean Roll, those Events are dealt with one-by-one, in the order in which they appear
in their respective Event table, starting with the Event at the top row of the table.

\newpage

\subsection{Costs, Risks and Rewards}

Tables 24-26, below, list Events along with a brief description of each. Detailed
descriptions and mechanics for each kind of Event follow in a subsequent Section.

\begin{table}[4]
Cost    &  Chance     &   Description
Hunger  &  50% + Level&   Increase Hunger, deplete Food Items, bestow Starving
Passage &  45% + Level&   Grants a chance to find a new Room
Effects &  30% + Level&   Apply, or modify the rating of deleterious Effects
Darkness&  25% + Level&   Deplete lighting Items or suffer in Darkness
Spoilage&  15% + Level&   Food Items have a chance to become Spoiled
\end{table}
\label{Costs.}[table]

\begin{table}[4]
Risk          &  Chance     &  Description
Encounter     &  50% + Level&  Meet the nest's denizens
Item (Unknown)&  30% + Level&  Find as yet unidentified Food Items
Obstacle      &  20% + Level&  Prevents further Exploration until removed
Infection     &  10% + Level&  Bestows the Infection Effect
\end{table}
\label{Risks.}[table]

\begin{table}[3]
Reward      &  Chance             & Description
Room        &  100% - Level       & Spend a Room to Explore, Hunt or Forage
Shortcut    &  Level - 50         & Takes you closer to the Job Target
Item (Known)&  25% + Level        & Find a previously identified Food Item
Resource    &  15% + Level        & Materials to build a Shelter for Resting and Healing
Level       &  10% + Level        & Entrance to a new, deeper Nest Level
Secret      &  Perception - Level & Generates a random Cost, Risk or Reward
\end{table}
\label{Rewards.}[table]

\begin{example}
Brody's Wasp character must pay a Cost as the result of an Exploration Action. Brody
rolls a d100 and references the result on the Costs table (Table 24). The d100 result
is 37%. This matches the Chance of the Hunger and Passage Costs, thus a Hunger Event
and a Passage Event are generated. Hunger comes before Passage in Table 24, thus
Brody's Wasp must first pay the Hunger Cost, then the Passage Cost must be paid.
\end{example}

\newpage

\subsection{Level Rating}

When an Event, or a Feature of the Nest environment need to be quantified, the
Quantification Die rolled depends on the Nest Level. An example of a Nest environment
Feature that requires quantification is the rating of Darkness in a Room.

Each Nest Level has a percentile rating. Table 27 below lists Nest Levels' ratings and
their corresponding Quantification dice, used to quantify Nest Features and Events.

\begin{table}[4]
Level  &   Features Die&   Costs / Risks Die&   Rewards Die
0-20%  &   d20         &   d40              &   d120
21-40% &   d40         &   d60              &   d100
41-60% &   d60         &   d80              &   d80
61-80% &   d80         &   d100             &   d60 
81-100%&   d100        &   d120             &   d40 
\end{table}
\label{Nest Levels and Quantification dice.}[table]

_Increasing Level ratings_ The rating of the Nest Level changes every time a character
spends a Level Reward to explore a new Nest Level. At that time, the Costs/Risks Die
corresponding to the current Nest Level is rolled to increase the new Level's rating. The
effect of this Quantification method is that as the characters delve deeper into the
Nest, the chance to find a Level with 100% rating, where the target of their Job is
found, increases.

\newpage

\subsection{The Environment Pool}

As described in earlier Sections, Environments can be used as resources to pay Costs,
reap Rewards, or play a minigame. To track the Environments generated so-far in the game,
players have a communal Environment Pool. This pool is simply a list of all the
Environments generated so far, and their properties.

\begin{box}[Tracking the Environment Pool]
Players are free to track their Environment Pool as best suits them, for example by
drawing a map of Environments and their connections and contents, etc.
\end{box}

One way to track an Environment Pool is to tabulate its contents. Table 28 gives an
example of such tabulation.

\begin{table}[3]
Environment Id&  Spent?&  Found In  &  Connections&  Notes
Entrance Room &  Yes   &  Start     &  Red Room   &
Red Room      &  Yes   &  Entrance  &  Black Room &  Shelter built
Black Room    &  No    &  Red Room  &  Red Room   &
Shortcut 1    &  Yes   &  Black Room&  Level 30%  &  Connects Black Room to Level 30%
Level 43%     &  Yes   &  Black Room&             &
Passage Right &  Yes   &  Entrance  &             &  Connects Entrance to Red Room
Passage Left  &  Yes   &  Red Room  &             &  Connects Red Room to Black Room
Passage Up    &  No    &  Red Room  &             &
\end{table}
\label{Environment Pool}[table]

In Table 28, the "Environment Id" column lists a descriptive name for each generated
Environment (though one that should preferrably be kept short). This name is up to the
players to come up with. For example, a Room may be the "Black Fungus Room", because
Black Fungus was found while Foraging in it; or a Room may be the "Sad Aphids Farm",
because Aphids were found penned in the Room and they looked sad; and so on.

The "Spent" column records whether an Environment has been spent: either to pay a Cost,
or to reap a Reward, or to initiate a Survival and Exploration, Hunting and Foraging or
Resting and Healing minigame.

_Going Back_ Environments can only be spent once from the Environment Pool, but
characters are free to visit them again for whatever reason, for example to try and find
an Item dropped to the floor of a Room. Additionally, a character, or an enemy, may be
forced to retreat during Combat, in which case they will likely end up in a Room already
visited. In such cases a character can move back in an Environment that has already been
spent, without spending it again.


The "Found In" column notes the Room in which an Environment was generated as the result
of an Exploration Action.

The "Connections" column notes the other Environments to which an Environment is
connected. "Connected" means that there exists: a Passage; or a Shortcut; or a Shaft;
that leads to the connected Environment.

The "Notes" column is for players to mark down anything they wish to remember about the
Environment. In the example in Table 28 above, the players have noted that a Shelter was
built into the Red Room, and the connections between Environments found so-far.

\newpage

\subsection{Survival and Exploration Steps}

The Survival and Exploration minigame is carried out in distinct steps, listed below.
Unlike Combat, Survival and Exploration is not divided into Rounds or Turns. Instead,
each of the steps listed below is taken in the order in which it is listed, then the
minigame ends. A new Survival and Exploration minigame can begin immediately afterwards,
if the players so wish; otherwise, the players are free to control their characters as
they see fit.

\begin{box}[Survival and Exploration Steps]

1. Begin Survival and Exploration.

2. Form an Exploration Party (decide which characters go exploring).

3. Spend a Room to pay the cost of the Exploration Action.

4. Resolve the Exploration Action.

5. Generate, then pay Costs determined by the outcome of the Exploration Action.

6. Generate, then face Risks determined by the Exploration Action.

7. Generate, then reap Rewards, determined by the Exploration Action.

8. Survival and Exploration Ends.

\end{box}

Each of the Steps in the Survival and Exploration Steps box above are described in detail
in the following Sections.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Begin Survival and Exploration}

Survival and Exploration begins when a player declares that her character's Intent is to
"Explore the Nest".

"Explore the Nest" is the formulaic Intent of the Exploration Action (described in
Section 3.7.7.4). A player is free to express her character's Intent to explore the Nest
in her own words, as long as it's clear that the characer wants to go exploring. If
that's not clear, the GQ can always ask the player to clarify. If the player isn't sure
what her character's Intent means in mechanical terms, the decision is made by the GQ
whether to start a Survival and Exploration minigame, or not.

If more than one player wish their characters to explore the Nest, they can say so at
this point. Otherwise they can do so in the next Step.
\newpage

\subsubsection{Form an Exploration Party}

It's common for more than one character to explore the Nest at a time. In particular, all
the player characters may go exploring together, or the players may split their
characters into groups that will explore the Nest separately.

A group of characters exploring the Nest is an Exploration Party. To form an Exploration
Party the players decide between then which characters explore the Nest together. For
each such group, one Exploration Party is formed.

For each Exploration Party, a separate Survival and Exploration Action is taken.
Nominate one character in each Exploration Party to be the "Scout" of the Party. The
Scout's Exploration Feature is used as the Effort for the subsequent Exploration Action.
For every other character in the Party, their Exploration Feature is used as a static
positive modifier to the Exploration Action.

_Tracking Exploration Parties_ To facilitate the distinction between Exploration Parties,
if more than one are formed, the GQ or the players can assign names to each party, or
describe the direction where a party is heading (this is despite the fact that Nest
environments do not specify clear directions). Tere are no specific rules for this. As an
example, if the characters split into two Exploration Parties, the players can declare
that one party is exploring "to the North" and the other "to the South". Then the GQ and
the players can refer to the two parties as "the North Party" and the "South Party". The
GQ will probably want to make a note of what characters are in each Exploration Party.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Spend a Room to take an Exploration Action}

For one or more characters to take an Exploration Action, their players must spend a free
Room from their Environment Pool. Mark a Room as "used" in the pool, so that it is not
spent again later. Then resolve the Exploration Action as described in the following
Section.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Resolve the Exploration Action}

As described in earlier Sections, the Survival and Exploration minigame is initiated when
one or more players decides that their characters will go exploring the Nest. During the
Survival and Exploration minigame an Exploration Action is taken by the exploring
character, or characters. This Section defines the formula for the Exploration Action.

_Party Scout_ When more than one characters take part in the same Exploration Action,
i.e. when an Exploration Party is formed, one character is nominated as the Scout and
each other character in the Exploration Party supports the Scout with her Exploration
Feature applied as a static, positive modifier to the Scout's Effort. 

The outcome of the Exploration Action determines the number, and type of Events that
occur as a result of the Action. Three Events of up to three different types will occur,
depending on the DoS of the Exploration Action. The formula for the Exploration Action is
listed below.

Name of the Minigame: ............... Survival and Exploration
Participating Entities: ............. Characters, Nest Environment
List of Minigame Intents: ........... Explore the Nest
List of Minigame Actions: ........... Explore
Effort Variables: ................... Exploration
Resistance Variables: ............... Nest Level
Modifier Variables: ................. +Eusociology, +Perception

Outcomes of the six Degrees of Success and Failure:

\begin{table}[12]
Degree of Success &    Outcome
Critical Success  &    Reward, Reward, Reward
Complete Success  &    Risk, Reward, Reward
Partial Success   &    Cost, Risk, Reward
Partial Failure   &    Cost, Risk, Risk
Complete Failure  &    Cost, Cost, Risk
Critical Failure  &    Cost, Cost, Cost
\end{table}
\label{Exploration Action Formula.}[figure]

The acting character, or the Party Scout, may add her Eusociology and Perception as
static positive modifiers to the Exploration Roll.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generate and pay Costs}

If the Outcome column of the Degrees of Success Table of the Exploration Action formula
includes one or more instances of the word "Cost", follow the steps below to generate,
and pay Costs.

   1. For each instance of the word "Cost":
   
   2. Roll d100.
   
   3. Look up the result on the Costs Table. 
   
   4. Each Cost with a Chance that is equal to, or higher than the result of the d100
   Roll is "generated".

   Costs are generated in the order in which they appear in the Costs table, Table
   23, starting with the first Cost (Hunger) in the top row of the Table.

   5. Each character in the Exploration Party pays each generated Cost in order of
   generation.

The Costs Table is reproduced below as Table 29 for the reader's convenience.

\begin{table}[4]
Cost    &  Chance     &   Description
Hunger  &  50% + Level&   Increase Hunger, deplete Food Items, bestow Starving
Passage &  45% + Level&   Grants a chance to find a new Room
Effects &  30% + Level&   Apply, or modify the rating of deleterious Effects
Darkness&  25% + Level&   Deplete lighting Items or suffer in Darkness
Spoilage&  15% + Level&   Food Items have a chance to become Spoiled
\end{table}
\label{Costs.}[table]

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generate and face Risks}

If the Outcome column of the Degrees of Success Table of the Exploration Action formula
includes one or more instances of the word "Risk", follow the steps below to generate,
and face Risks.

   1. For each instance of the word "Risk":
   
   2. Roll d100.
   
   3. Look up the result on the Risks Table. 
   
   4. Each Risk with a Chance that is equal to, or higher than the result of the
      d100 Roll is "generated".

      Risks are generated in the order in which they appear in the Risks table, Table
      23, starting with the first Risk (Encounter) in the top row of the Table.

   5. All characters in the Exploration Party face the first generated Risk; once the
      first Risk is faced and all Actions or minigames resulting are resolved, all
      characters in the Exploration Party face the second generated Risk; and so on,
      until all generated Risks have been faced.

The Risks Table is reproduced below as Table 30 for the reader's convenience.

\begin{table}[4]
Risk          &  Chance     &  Description
Encounter     &  50% + Level&  Meet the nest's denizens
Item (Unknown)&  30% + Level&  Find as yet unidentified Food Items
Obstacle      &  20% + Level&  Prevents further Exploration until removed
Infection     &  10% + Level&  Bestows the Infection Effect
\end{table}
\label{Risks.}[table]

_Combat Risk_ Risks include the "Encounter" Event which may cause a Combat minigame to
begin. In that case, subsequent Risks are only faced once the Combat minigame has ended.

_Missing Characters_ If some of the characters in the Exploration Party that faced the
original Encounter Risk that initiated a Combat minigame are no longer in the same Room
as the rest of the Party (usually because they are fleeing from Combat) those missing
characters do not face any subsequent Risks until they return to that Room.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Generate and reap Rewards}

If the Outcome column of the Degrees of Success Table of the Exploration Action formula
includes one or more instances of the word "Reward", follow the steps below to generate,
and reap Rewards.

   1. For each instance of the word "Reward":
   
   2. Roll d100.
   
   3. Look up the result on the Rewards Table. 
   
   4. Each Reward with a Chance that is equal to, or higher than the result of the d100
      Roll is "generated".

      Rewards are generated in the order in which they appear in the Rewards table,
      Table 31, starting with the first Reward (Room) in the top row of the Table.

   5. If a generated Reward is an Item, any character may add the Item to her Inventory.
      If no character adds the Item to her Inventory the Item remains on the Room floor
      as a "dropped" Item.

      Which character picks up which Item is left to the players to decide. There are no
      specific rules to manage that decision.

   6. If a generated Reward is a Room, Shortcut, or Level, the Reward is added to the
      player characters' communal Environment Pool.

   7. If a generated Reward is a Secret, follow the description of the Secret Event: this
      usually means that a new Event is generated.

The Rewards Table is reproduced below as Table 31 for the reader's convenience.

\begin{table}[3]
Reward      &  Chance             & Description
Room        &  100% - Level       & Spend a Room to Explore, Hunt or Forage
Shortcut    &  Level - 50         & Takes you closer to the Job Target
Item (Known)&  25% + Level        & Find a previously identified Food Item
Resource    &  15% + Level        & Materials to build a Shelter for Resting and Healing
Level       &  10% + Level        & Entrance to a new, deeper Nest Level
Secret      &  Perception - Level & Generates a random Cost, Risk or Reward.
\end{table}
\label{Rewards.}[table]
\newpage

\subsubsection{Survival and Exploration Ends}

Once all Costs, Risks and Rewards, are generated and dealt with as described in the
previous Sections, the Survival and Exploration minigame ends.

Nothing special happens when Survival and Exploration ends. Players are free to control
their characters as before. 
\newpage

\subsection{Cost Events}

The following Sections define the rules for the various Cost Events generated during the
Survival and Exploration minigame.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Hunger}

\begin{box}[Effects of Hunger]
Hunger can make a character weak. Prolongued Hunger leads to starvation, which leads
to death from starvation.
\end{box}

When a Hunger Cost is paid, the character paying the Cost must consume one Food Item from
her Inventory. 

If the character consumes a Food Item, make a Quantification Roll to reduce the
character's Hunger rating. See Section 2.11.6.7. for the rules of consuming Food Items.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Starvation}

A character who does not have a Food Item in her Inventory cannot pay a Hunger Cost.

A player may decide that her character will not consume any Food Items to pay a Hunger
Cost (even if the character has a Food Item in her Inventory).

If a character cannot (or her player will her not to) pay a Hunger Cost, then:

* If the character is Starving, the character dies.

* Else, if the character's Hunger is less than 100%, make a Quantification Roll to
  Increase the character's Hunger.

* Or, if the character's Hunger is 100% the character becomes Starving. Tick the
  tickbox of the Starving Effect in the Hunger box, as a reminder.

The player of the character paying the Hunger Cost makes the Roll and ticks the Starving
box.

While a character is Starving, a Shift Down applies to the DoS of all Actions taken by
the character.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Passage}

\begin{note}
A Passage is a tunnel, or other passageway, that leads further into the current Level
of the Nest. A Passage has a chance to lead to a Room but is not, itself, a Room.
That is why it is modelled as a Cost.
\end{note}

When A Passage Cost is paid, make a Boolean Roll with Effort equal to 100 minus the
rating of the current Level. Then:

* If the roll succeeds, the Passage leads to a Room. 

  In that case, add a Room to the player characters' Environment Pool.

* Otherwise, the Passage is a dead end.

  In that case, no Room is added to the characters' Environment Pool.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Effects (Cost)}

When an Effects Cost is paid, the character paying the Cost must check all Effects she is
subject to.

When an Effect is checked, there is a chance that it will trigger.

Refer to Section 2.11.5.3. for the rules of Checking Effects. Refer to Sections 2.11.5.4.
to 2.11.5.13. for the rules of triggering Effects.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Darkness}

\begin{box}[Effects of Darkness]
Darkness makes it harder to see things and to do things that require vision.
\end{box}

When a Darkness Cost is paid, the character paying the Cost must consume one Light Item
from her Inventory.

A character who does not have a Light Item in her Inventory cannot pay a Darkness Cost.

A player may decide that her character will not consume any Light Items to pay a Darkness
Cost (even if the character has a Light Item in her Inventory).

If a character cannot (or her player will her not to) pay a Darkness Cost, that character
has no light source.

If all of a character's Light Items become exhausted, that character has no light source.

If none of the characters in a Room has a light source, the Room is in Darkness. Make a
Quantification Roll to set the Darkness rating. The Quantification Die for the Roll is
the current Level's Costs / Risks die. The GQ makes the roll.

While a Room is in Darkness, all characters in the Room suffer a static, negative
modifier equal to the Room's Darkness rating to all their Actions that require vision.

_Blindness_ A character subject to a Blind Effect is only affected by Darkness if the
Darkness rating is higher than the character's Blind rating. A character who is not
affected by Darkness does not suffer a negative modifier to any tasks as a result of
being in a Room in Darkness.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Spoilage}

When a Spoilage Cost is paid, there is a chance that one or more Food Items will become
Spoiled. 

Only Food Items in the Inventory of a character paying the Spoilage Cost have a chance to
become Spoiled.

To pay a Spoilage Cost, make a single Boolean Roll and compare its result to the rating
of each Food Item in the Inventory of the character paying the Spoilage Cost.

For each Food Item in the character's Inventory:

* If the Boolean Roll beats the Food Item's rating, nothing happens: the Food Item does
  not become Spoiled.

* If the Boolean Roll matches the Food Item's rating, the Food Item becomes Spoiled.

  Prepend the word "Spoiled" to the Food Item's name.

  Food Items are spoiled as long as their name starts with the word "Spoiled".

\newpage

\subsubsection{Eating Spoiled Food Items}

A character who consumes a Spoiled Food Item may become ill as a result.

When a character consumes a Spoiled Food Item, make a full Qualification Roll to
determine the effects of the Spoiled Food Item on the character's health.

Resolve the Qualification Roll before making a Consumption Roll for the Food Item.

The Effort for the Roll is equal to the character's Stamina. The Resistance for the Roll
is equal to the Food Item's rating.

The player controlling the character who ate the Spoiled Food Item makes the Roll.

Use the following minigame formula to resolve the Qualification Roll.

Name of the Minigame: ............... Desperate Times
Participating Entities: ............. A Character, Spoilage Organisms
List of Minigame Intents: ........... Feed
List of Minigame Actions: ........... Eat Spoiled Food Item
Effort Variables: ................... Character's Stamina
Resistance Variables: ............... Food Item's rating
Modifier Variables: ................. None

Outcomes of the six Degrees of Success and Failure:

\begin{table}[12]
Degree of Success &    Outcome
Critical Success  &    The character is healed of 1 Wound
Complete Success  &    The character enjoys her Spoiled Food Item
Partial Success   &    The character is Poisoned: d40
Partial Failure   &    The character is Infected: d60
Complete Failure  &    The character is Blind: d80
Critical Failure  &    The character takes 1 Wound.
\end{table}

\newpage

\subsection{Risk Events (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Encounter (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Unknown Item (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Obstacle}

\begin{box}[Effects of Obstacles]
Obstacles stop characters from further exploring the Nest.
\end{box}

Obstacles are elements of the Nest Environment and have a single Feature: Obstruction.

When an Obstacle Risk is faced, roll the current Level's Costs/ Risks die to set the
Obstacle's Obstruction rating. The GQ makes the Roll.

An Obstacle with Obstruction: 0% is "torn down".

While an Obstacle's Obstruction rating is higher than 0%:

* Characters may not take any Exploration, Hunting, or Foraging Actions in the Room where
  the Obstacle was generated.

* No Risks or Rewards are generated as a result of the same Exploration Action that
  generated the Obstacle.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Tearing Obstacles down}

Characters may attempt to tear down an Obstacle, thus reducing its Obstruction rating to
0%.

To attempt to tear down an Obstacle, any character can take a Construction Action. Make a
Boolean Roll with Effort equal to the character's Construction rating. Then:

* If the roll succeeds, the Obstacle is torn down: its Obstruction rating becomes 0%. 

* If the roll fails, the character taking the Construction Action takes 1 Wound. The
  Obstacle is not torn down: its rating remains unchanged.

The player of the character taking the Construction Action makes the Roll.

_Building Resources_ When an Obstacle is torn down there is a chance that an amount of
building Resources will be generated. Make a Boolean Roll with Effort equal to the
Obstacle's initial rating (i.e. before its Obstruction is reduced to 0%). If the Roll
Succeeds, a building Resource Item remains on the floor of the Room where the Obstacle
was torn down. Roll to Set the Resource Item's rating. The GQ makes the roll.

_Blocked Path_ If all characters leave the Room where an Obstacle was generated and the
Obstacle's Obstruction rating is higher than 0%, no Risks and Rewards are generated as a
result of the Exploration Action that generated the Obstacle, even if the characters
return in the Room and tear the Obstacle down later.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Infection}

\begin{box}[Effects of Infection]
A character facing an Infection Risk may become Infected. If the character is already
Infected, her Infection may get worse.
\end{box}

When an Infection Risk is faced, make a Boolean Roll with Effort equal to the current
Level's rating. 

* If the Roll fails, nothing happens. The character escapes the Infection Risk.

* If the Roll succeeds, and the character facing the Infection Risk is not yet Infected
  (her Infected rating is 0%), the character becomes Infected.

  In that case make a Quantification Roll to set the character's Infected rating.

  The Quantification Die for the Roll is the current Level's Costs/ Risks die.

  Tick the Infected Effect's "Applies" tickbox as a reminder.

* If the Roll succeeds, and the character facing the Infection Risk is already Infected,
  (her Infected rating is more than 0%) the Infection spreads.

  In that case, the character's Infected Effect triggers.

  See Section 2.11.5.9. for the rules of triggering an Infected Effect.

The player controlling the character facing an Infection Risk makes both Rolls and makes
the changes to the character's sheet.

\begin{note}
The risk of Infection while exploring a Nest comes from disease-causing
microorgranisms that inhabit the Nest. Common sources of infections are fungi and
bacteria that live in the soil or the air of the Nest. Characters may become Infected
simply by walking into a new Room and coming into contact with the microorganisms
living in the Room.
\end{note}
\newpage

\subsection{Reward Events (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Room (Reward)}

When a character reaps a Room Reward, add a Room to the characters' Environment Pool.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Shortcut}

When a character reaps a Shortcut Reward, make a Quantification Roll to increase the
current Nest Level's rating.

The Quantification Die for the Roll is the current Level's Rewards Die.

The player controlling the character who reaped the Reward makes the Roll.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Level (Reward)}

When a character reaps a Level Reward, make a Quantification Roll to increase the current
Nest Level's rating.

The Quantification Die for the Roll is the current Level's Rewards Die.

The player controlling the character who reaped the Reward makes the Roll.

Add a Room to the characters' Environment Pool. This new Room represents the entrance to
the new Level.

\begin{box}[Special Rule: Levelling down]
A Level Reward can only be reaped once per Exploration Action. If multiple Rewards
must be reaped as a result of the same Exploration Action, only one Level Reward can
be generated until a new Exploration Action is taken.
\end{box}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Known Item (TBD)}
\newpage

\subsubsection{Resource}

When a character reaps a Resource Reward, the character acquires a Building Resources
Inventory Item:

* If the character already has a Building Resources Item in her Inventory, make a
  Quantification Roll to increase this Item's rating.

* If the character does not have a Building Resources Item in her Inventory, add a new
  Building Resources Item to her Inventory.

  Then, make a Quantification Roll to set the new Item's rating.

In both cases, the Quantification Die for the Roll is the current Level's Rewards Die.

The player of the character who reaped the Resources reward makes the roll and changes
the character's sheet.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Secret}

When a character reaps a Secret Reward, a random Cost, Risk or Reward is generated.

Randomise Costs, Risks and Rewards:

* Roll 1d6 to select Cost (1-2), Risk (3-4) or Reward (5-6).

* Randomise the Events of the selected type.

  To randomise Costs, roll 1d10 to select Hunger (1-2), Passage(3-4), Effects (5-6),
  Darkness (7-8) or Spoilage (9-10).

  To randomise Risks, roll 1d8 to select Encounter (1-2), Unknown Item (3-4), Obstacle
  (5-6) or Infection (7-8).

  To randomise Rewards, roll 1d6 to select Room (1), Shortcut (2), Level (3), Known Item
  (4), Resource (5) or Secret (6).

The character who reaped the Secret Reward pays, or faces, or reaps the randomly selected
Cost, or Risk, or Reward, accordingly.

\begin{note}
A Secret Reward can cause a new Secret Reward to be reaped.

\section{Termites}

Termites are detritivores: they feed on rotting plant matter, wood and leaves. They make
their nests underground, by borrowing into wood, or by building above-ground structures
with soil and plant matter bound with their feces. Well, yes. Termite nests are connected
to networks of underground tunnels that are used to forage in safety. In Nests & Insects
Termite Nests are gigagntic Cathedrals extending to many meters above and below ground.

Termites are orgranised into castes, most of them without reproductive ability or organs,
and without wings or eyes. Termite life is hard but the Nest thrives. The worker caste
forage and tend to the Nest and the other castes. The Soldier caste protects the nest,
willingly sacrificing its life. The two reproductive castes, the King and Queen, are
responsible for making sure the Nest is always full of millions of Termites of all
castes.

\newpage

\subsection{Worker Termite}

Worker Termites are unarmed and blind, and cannot fight, but they are numerous, swarm,
and will raise the alarm as soon as they become aware that the Nest has been breached.
Workers raise the alarm by bumping into each other and causing each other to release
alarm pheromones. The pheromone trail spreads throughout the nest attracting more workers
and, soon enough, soldiers. Attacking a swarm of workers causes them to release alarm
pheromones faster.
% TODO: that last bit is missing a rule.

\begin{box}[Special Rule - Alarm Pheromones]

At the start of each Combat Turn the GQ makes a Boolean Roll against the Worker
Termites' Swarming. If the roll succeeds, new Termites arrive. Roll on Table 33 below
and choose the result with the lowest "Chance to Summon" that is higher than the roll
value.

\newpage

\subsection{Minor Termite Soldier - Autothyte}

Minor Termite Soldiers are about as big as Worker Termites, but can fight and form
swarms. Like Ants, they don't suffer wound penalties and are blind. They cannot fly. In
Combat they attack intruders by grabbing them with their mandibles and attempting to
crush them. When their Special Attack hits, they explode and spread a sticky liquid that
immobilises enemies caught in it. To be clear: the attack kills the Soldier (but only the
one that actually exploded- its friends soldier on; mechanically speaking that means the
Soldiers lose one wound).

\begin{box}[Special Rule - Nest Guardians]

Autothyte Soldiers do not set upon enemies directly, rather they stand in place in
front of their tunnels and attempt to stop intruders from entering the tunnels. When
an Autothyte Soldier's Special Attack fires, there is a 60% chance that the tunnel
entrance that it is guarding will be blocked by the sticky substance secreted during
the attack, and become impassable.

Mechanically speaking, an Autothyte Soldier's Special Attack creates an Obstacle, as
described in Section 3.7.9.3.

\end{box}
\newpage

\subsection{Major Termite Soldier - Autothyte}

The Major Termite Soldier is a larger, stronger version of the Minor Soldier, but also
rarer. In mechanical terms, Major Autothye Soldiers have more powerful versions of the
Minor Soldiers' Attacks and do not swarm.

\subsection{Nasute Soldier}

Nasute Soldiers have an elongated snout in place of the large crushing mandibles of other
Soldier termites. In Combat, Nasutes eject from this snout a noxious liquid that
immobilises intruders and can kill them just with the force of the blow. This is called a
"Fontanellar Gun". While Nasutes are blind as other worker and soldier termites, they are
wicked shots with their Fontanellar Guns and can hit targets at Long range. Nasutes can
fire their Fontanellar Guns repeatedly even though it tears off the lower part of their
modified mandibles.

\begin{box}[Special Rule - Alarm Gun]

The ejecta of the Nasutes' Fontanellar Gun include an alarm pheromone that compels
other Nasutes in the vicinity of a Gun's discharge to fire their own, towards the 
same direction.

Mechanically, whenever a Nasute soldier A discharges its Fontanellar Gun, there is a
40% chance that another Nasute Soldier B, participating in Combat but who has not yet
taken an Attack Action this Turn, will Attack the same target. Roll to randomly
select Nasute Soldier B if necessary.

The Attack is made in the Turn of the Nasute Soldier A. The Attack counts as Nasute
Soldier B's Attack for the Round (that means it can't take another Attack Action in
the same Round).

Nasute Soldier's B discharge of its Fontanellar Gun is also subject to this rule, so
it is possible, with a bit of bad luck, for all the Nasutes participating in Combat 
to discharge their guns towards the same target in one Turn, one after another, in a
chain of sticky, noxious death.
