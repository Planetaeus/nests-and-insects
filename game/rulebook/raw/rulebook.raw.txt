                                        Overview
                                        ========
\begin{box}[Note to the reader]
This Section is a short introduction to the setting, the game and the system of Nests
& Insects. It is designed to give you a general idea of the game. It is not designed
to give you everything you need to play the game. That information is found in the
text that follows this Overview Section.
\end{box}

The Setting
-----------

Nests & Insects is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) for 2 to 7 players. One player
assumes the role of the Game Queen and describes the game world to the other players. The
other players control characters who explore, and interact with, the game world.

Players' characters are arthropods that belong to one of six classes: Spider, Wasp,
Scorpion, Ladybug, Beetle and Ants (plural). The characters are mercenaries: assassins
and thugs, hired to invade a Nest and carry out a Job on behalf of some arthropod client.
Nests are the homes of eusocial insects: the nests of Bees, Ants and Termites. Common
Jobs are to assasinate the Queen, or the King; steal nectar, honey, honeydew, aphids
(farmed by ants) or fungi (cultivated by termites); steal, or kill, nymphs; or sabotage
the Nest.

At the beginning of a new game the players' characters enter a Nest to carry out their
Job armed with their natural weapons and armour: mandibles, pincers, stingers, carapaces,
wings, venom, webs. During a Job characters must survive combat with the soldier castes
guarding the Nests. They must also hunt or forage for food to avoid weakening and
starving to death. While foraging, characters may find food items, such as nectar and
fungi, that can be consumed to provide not only sustenance but also healing, enhanced
physical and mental abilities and other benefits.

The Game
--------

Nests & Insects is a Roguelike TTRPG. It is "Roguelike" because it is inspired by
computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) of the Roguelike genre, like Nethack, Angband, Moria
and Ancient Domains of Mystery.

A "Roguelike TTRPG" is a case of board games imitating computer games, imitating board
games: most roguelike CRPGs are inspired by TTRPGs, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, the
grandaddy of all TTRPGs (and all CRPGs to boot). Roguelikes borrow from TTRPGs the
hack-and-slash, dungeon-crawling style of gameplay and common themes of fantasy and
science fiction. Nests & Insects borrows from Roguelike CRPGs game elements like:
procedural generation; a focus on hack-and-slash gameplay; lethal combat; freedom to
tackle challenges in different ways; a focus on exploration of, and experimentation in
the game world; and the need for characters to find sustenance or die.

While Nests & Insects is a roleplaying game, it is not focused on roleplaying, because it
is very difficult for humans to roleplay arthropods (and vice-versa). As in Roguelike
CRPGs, Nests & Insects does not come with a built-in, pre-scripted story, and it is
instead designed to encourage a story to emerge naturally from the interaction of the
players' characters with the rules of the game and the procedurally generated elements of
the game world (including Jobs, Nests and Nests' inhabitants).

Nests & Insects is designed to be played with no preparation other than reading some of
the rules. At the start of a new game players select a class that determines all of a
character's beginning stats (collectively called Features). The Game Queen then rolls to
procedurally generate the first Room in the entrance to the first Level of the Nest, and
the characters enter and begin their Job. After visiting a Room and defeating its
challenges characters get a chance to rest and recoup their strength, and players can use
experience gained to improve their characters. The game ends when the characters fulfill
the terms of the Job, or give up, or run away, or die.

Everything encountered by characters during a Job is procedurally generated. If the Game
Queen wishes, she can create hand-crafted Rooms, Levels, enemies, items, etc, and include
them in the game; but that is not strictly necessary.

The System
----------

Nests & Insects' roleplaying system is called Fuzzy d100 (fd100). It is a "percentile"
system where characters are defined by Features rated on a percentile scale from 1 to
100, and where a composite, "percentile" die (d100) is rolled to determine the outcome of
characters' actions. In Nests & Insects the d100 is comprised of two ten-sided dice
(d10s) with faces numbered 0, 1, ..., 9, rolled together and read as one to generate
results from "00" to "99".

The "Fuzzy" in the d100 name refers to the six possible Degrees of Success or Failure of
an action (DoS). To determine the DoS of an action, players describe the character's
intent, then roll a d100 and compare it to two target numbers, "Effort" and "Resistance".

To roll under Effort is to "match" Effort. To roll over, or equal to, Resistance, is to
"beat" Resistance. If the d100 roll matches Effort, the initial DoS is a Success,
otherwise it is a Failure. If the d100 roll beats Resistance, the initial Dos is a
Complete Success or a Partial Failure, otherwise it is a Partial Success or a Complete
Failure.

The initial DoS may change by comparison with additional target numbers, called
"modifiers", that can be either positive or negative. Matching a positive modifier
improves the DoS and failing to beat a negative modifier worsens the DoS. With modifiers,
the DoS may improve beyond a Complete Success, to a Critical Success, or worsen beyond a
Complete Failure, to a Critical Failure.

What the DoS of an action means depends on the character's description of the character's
intent. Once the DoS of the action is known, the Game Queen describes what happens as a
result of the character's action.

Table 1 describes the six Degrees of Success and Failure, and how they can be achieved.

\begin{table}[8]
Degree of Success &    Achieved by
Critical Success  &    Matching a positive Modifier after a Complete Success
Complete Success  &    Matching Effort and Beating Resistance
Partial Success   &    Matching Effort and Failing to Beat Resistance
Partial Failure   &    Failing to Match Effort and Beating Resistance
Complete Failure  &    Failing to Match Effort and Failing to Beat Resistance
Critical Failure  &    Failing to Beat a Negative Modifier after a Complete Failure
\end{table}
Table 1: Six Degrees of Success

Decile dice
-----------

Some actions require quantification of their results. To quantify the results of actions
on the same percentile scale as characters' Features, Nests & Insects uses "decile dice":
the d20, d40, d60, d80 and the d100 itself. The d20 is a single, twenty-sided die, with
faces numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 19. The d40, d60, d80 and d100 are composite dice, each
comprised of a d4, d6, d8, and d10, respectively, as the "ones" die; and a d10 as the
"tens" die. Both the "ones" and "tens" dice have faces numbered 0, 1, 2 ..., n-1, where n
is the number of faces on the die, just like the d10's comprising the d100. For example,
the d4 has faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, the d6 has faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

To generate a decile die result, the "ones" and "tens" of the decile die are rolled
together, the "tens" die is placed to the left of the "ones" die and the digits on the
top faces of the two dice read left-to-right, as if reading a printed numeral. This way,
each decile die generates numbers from 00 to one less than the number of faces on the
decile die: 39 on a d40, 59 on a d60, 79 on a d80, and 99 on a d100. The d20 needs no
special reading and generates numbers in the range 0 to 19.

\begin{box}[Example 1]
The d60 is a composite decile die comprised of a d6, with faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 as a "tens" die, and a d10, with faces numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as
a "ones" die. When a d60 roll is made, the d6 and d10 are rolled together, the d6 is
placed to the left of the d10 and the digits showing are read left-to-right. Let a
d60 be rolled and suppose the d6 shows a "0", while the d10 shows a "0": in that
case, the d60 result is "00", or just "0". Suppose the d6 shows a "0" while the d10
shows a "4": in that case, the d60 result is "04", or just "4". Suppose the d6 shows
a "3" while the d10 shows an "8": in that case, the d60 result is "38".
\end{box}

Table 2 lists the five decile dice used in fd100, their component polyhedrals and their
numeric ranges. Decile dice are described in full detail in Section "Decile Dice" in the
"System" Chapter.

\begin{table}[4]
Decile die&  Range   &    Tens die &  Numbered  &  Ones die&  Numbered  
d20       &  0 to 19 &    Not any! &            &  d20     &  0,1,...,19

d60       &  0 to 59 &    d6       &  0,1,...,5 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d80       &  0 to 79 &    d8       &  0,1,...,7 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d100      &  0 to 99 &    d10      &  0,1,...,9 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
\end{table}
Table 2: Decile dice, used for quantification of percentile effects. d100 is also a
decile die. The d20 does not need a "tens" die and is rolled on its own.

Minigames
---------

Nests & Insects is organised around "minigames" that define special rules for common
in-game tasks. There are four minigames: Combat; Survival and Exploration; Hunting and
Foraging; and Resting and Healing. Minigames are described in detail in Section
"Minigames" of the "System" Chapter.

In the Combat minigame, characters have two Attack actions: a Base Attack and a Special
Attack. The DoS of a character's Attack action determines which Attack hits, or misses.

When an Attack hits, it causes injury to the target, and may bestow detrimental effects
on enemies, or beneficial effects on allies. When an Attack misses, the attacker suffers
detrimental effects. Injury causes the DoS of subsequent actions to worsen. 

The Combat minigame also tracks characters' Disposition, representing their position in
battle and their morale. Better disposition improves the DoS of subsequent Combat actions
and worse disposition worsens it. 

\begin{table}[8]
Degree of Success&        Outcome
Critical Success &        Both Attacks Hit
Complete Success &        Special Attack Hits
Partial Success  &        Base Attack Hits
Partial Failure  &        Base Attack Misses
Complete Failure &        Special Attack Misses
Critical Failure &        Both Attacks Miss
\end{table}

                                     Character Sheet
                                     ===============

In Nests & Insects characters are described by percentile-rated Features, listed in a
character sheet. 

There are five categories of Features: Attributes, Combat Conditions, Survival Features,
Abilities and Inventory Items. Features and their use in the game are described in detail
in the "Features" Section of the "System" Chapter. This Section briefly introduces the
different Features as they are listed in the character sheet.

Each character class has its own character sheet, based on the character sheet template
in the preceding page, with its own, pre-set, values. The Character Sheet is divided into
5 areas, some with sub-areas. These are listed in Table 4.

\begin{table}[4]
Area Name   &   Sub-Areas

Combat Stats&   Condition box, Disposition Track, Attack boxes
Survival    &   Hunger box, Luck box
Abilities   &   Specific Abilities box, Common Abilities box, Effects box, Inventory box
\end{table}
Table 4: Areas and sub-areas in a character sheet.

The following Sections describe each area and sub-area of the character sheet.

Class Header
------------

The first area in a character sheet is its Class Header (Figure 1), listing the name of
the game and the name of a character's Class.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 1: Character sheet template; class header. In a completed sheet "CLASS" is
replaced by the name of the character's class, e.g. Wasp, Spider, Ants, etc.

Attributes Area
---------------

Under the Class Header is the Attributes Area (Figure 2), listing Class Attributes.
Attributes are Features that represent innate abilities of characters in a Class.

Figure 2: Attributes Area.

Nests & Insects characters have eight Attributes (Table 5).

\begin{table}[6]
Attribute&       Description
Speed    &       How fast the character can move
Skill    &       Dexterity, precision and fine manipulation ability
Strength &       Physical strength, used to push, pull, lift, throw, and break doo- stuff
Stamina  &       Physical toughness and endurance, resistance to physical harm
Smarts   &       Intelligence, logic, reasoning and problem solving skill
Charms   &       Charisma, talent for communication and influencing others' behaviour
Ken      &       Wisdom, common sense, and knowledge of the world
Passions &       Willpower, morale, strength of spirit and courage
\end{table}
Table 5: Character Attributes

_XP Tickboxes_ In the Attributes Area each attribute is listed with an empty tickbox to
the left, marked "XP", as shown in Figure 3. This is an *XP tickbox*. "XP" stands for
"Experience Points". XP tickboxes are also found next to Combat Conditions, Survival
Features and Common Abilities.

Combat Stats Area
-----------------

The Combat Stats area starts with the Combat Stats header (Figure 5).

╠►Combat Stats◄════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 5: Header of the Combat Stats Area.

The Combat Stats area lists Features used in the Combat minigame. It has 3 sub-areas: the
Condition box, the Disposition Track and the Attack boxes.

Condition box
-------------

The Condition box (Figure 6) lists a character's Initiative, Threat Rate, Survival Rate
and Wounds.

┌[Condition]──────────────<Rules Reminder>──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ □ Initiative...:[____%] (Match/Beat to start Combat in Holding/Recoiling Disposition) │
│ □ Threat Rate..:[____%] (Match/Beat Attacker's TR to Hit/Miss Target)................ │
│ □ Survival Rate:[____%] (Match/Beat Target's SR to Hit/Miss with Base/Special Attack) │
│ □ Wounds/Max...:[__/__] (1 Wound = 1 Shift Down. When Wounds ≥ Max, character dies).. │
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 6: Condition box.

The Condition box includes some reminder text to help players make sense of their
character's Condition in Combat. The four Combat Conditions are explained, briefly,
below.

* Initiative determines a character's initial Disposition, and Turn order, in Combat.

* Threat Rate is used as the Effort of an attacker in Attack Actions.

* Survival Rate is used as the Resistance of an Attack's target in Attack Actions.

* Wounds count the injury caused by attacks. If the count of Wounds reaches its Maximum,
  the character is killed.

Disposition Track
-----------------

The Disposition Track (Figure 7) follows a character's Disposition, a representation of
both position and morale in Combat.
\newpage

├─<Disposition Track>───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ (Advance this way -->) ........................................ (<-- Recoil this way) │
│ ○ Retreating...... ○ Recoiling..... ○ Holding...... ○ Advancing...... ○ Charging..... │
└<^Cant Attack>─────<^-30%>──────────<^Doing Good>───<^+30%>───────────<^Shift Up>──────┘
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 7: Disposition Track. Modifiers apply to all Actions in Combat.

The Disposition track includes reminder text to point out the direction in which
Disposition Advances (increases) or Recoils (decreases) in Combat. Disposition is better
the further it moves towards "Charging".

There are five Dispositions in the Disposition Track, discussed briefly below.

* Retreating: The character is running away from enemies and cannot Attack, or support
  Allies, or take any offensive action.

* Recoiling: The character is falling back, or taken aback, by the force of an Attack.

* Holding: the character is steady and ready to attack and defend.

* Advancing: the character is bold and advancing towards the enemy.

* Charging: the character is impetuous and is Charging ahead Attacking in full force.

Attack boxes
------------

The Attack boxes (Figure 8) list the details of a character's two Attacks: her Base
Attack and Special Attack. Each character class has its own Base and Special Attacks.

┌[Base Attack]─────────────────────────────┐┌[Special Attack]──────────────────────────┐ 
│ Name:................................... ││ Name:................................... │

Survival Area
-------------

The Survival Area begins with the Survival header (Figure 9).

╠►Survival◄════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 9: Survival header, demarcating the Survival Area.

The Survival Area has two sub-Areas: the Food box, used in the Survival minigame; and the
Luck box.

Food box
--------

The Food box (Figure 10) lists the character's Hunger rating and has a radio-button for
the Starving Effect. Starving is ticked when Hunger reaches 100%. While Starving, a
character takes a penalty in the DoS of all minigame Actions.

┌[Food]───────────────────┐
│ ○ Hunger........[___0%] │
└<^Starving>──────────────┘
───────────────────────────
Figure 10: Food box.

Luck box
--------

The Luck box (Figure 11) lists the character's Luck. Luck is used to avoid the worst
outcome of Actions, Attacks and events in the game. The current Luck rating is marked by
an up-arrow (^) in the bottom of the Luck box.

┌[Luck]───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [11%].[22%].[33%].[44%].[55%].[66%].[77%].[88%].[99%].[00%].│
└──^──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 11: Luck box, with the Luck marker on 11% (starting Luck).

Characters start the game with 11% Luck. During the game a character's Luck rating
changes whenever the player rolls a d100 and the same digit appears on both d10s. This is
known as "rolling a double". When a double is rolled, the Luck marker is moved to the
rating that matches the double.
\newpage

Abilities Area
--------------

The Abilities Area begins with the Abilities header (Figure 12).

╠►Abilities◄═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣▓
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 12: Abilities header, demarcating the Abilities area.

The Abilities Area has four sub-Areas: the Specific Abilities box, the Common Abilities
box, the Effects box and the Inventory box.

Specific Abilities box
----------------------

The Specific Abilities box (Figure 13) lists Abilities that are particular to a Species
(hence, "Specific"). Nests & Insects classes model individuals of a species hence each
character class has its own Specific Abilities.

┌[Specific Abilities]────────┐
│ Carapace..........:[___0%] │
│ Flying............:[___0%] │
│ Swarming..........:[___0%] │
│ Venomous..........:[___0%] │
│ Web Weaving.......:[___0%] │
└────────────────────────────┘
──────────────────────────────
Figure 13: Specific Abilities box.

There are five Specific Abilities that character classes can have: Carapace, Flying,
Swarming, Venomous, or Web Weaving. These are briefly described below.

* Carapace: the character has a hardened carapace that protects her in combat. Beetle,
  Ladybug and Scorpion have Carapace.

* Flying: the character can fly. Flying characters are harder to hit in Combat by
  terrestrial attackers. Beetle, Ladybug and Wasp have Flying.

* Swarming: the character is a swarm of individual insects, or can summon conspecifics to
  assist her.

  In Combat, a character with high Swarming ignores all Wound penalties, but with each
  Wound, an individual is lost from the Swarm. Ants have high Swarming. 

  A character with low Swarming starts as a single individual but can summon more
  individuals of her species. Wasp has low Swarming.

* Venomous: the character has a venomous bite or sting and can bestow Effects such as
  Agony, Immobilised, Paralysed, or Poisoned to enemies in Combat, or otherwise.

* Web Weaving: the character can weave webs. Webs can be used to set traps or secure an
  area. Spider has Web Weaving.

Common Abilities box
--------------------

The Common Abilities box (Figure 14) lists Abilities common to all character classes.

┌[Common Abilities]────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ □ Construction.....:[____%] □ Hunting...........:[____%] │

Like Atributes and Conditions, Common Abilities have an XP Tickbox and can be improved
with experience. Table 6 briefly describes Common Abilities and their use.

\begin{table}[8]

Sneaking      &        Move and act with stealth
\end{table}
Table 6: Common Abilities with brief description.

Effects box
-----------

The Effects box (Figure 15) lists ten Effects that a character can be subject to.

Effects are generally detrimental conditions that can affect a character as a result of
Attacks in Combat, and other minigames.

┌[Effects]───────────────────────────────────┐
│ ○ Agony....:[___0%] ○ Immobilised.:[___0%] │
│ ○ Bleeding.:[___0%] ○ Infected....:[___0%] │

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Figure 15: Effects box.

Effects each have a radio button. When this is ticked it marks that the Effect "Applies",
i.e. that the character is currently subject to the Effect. The ten Effects in the Effect
box are listed in Table 7 along with a brief description of each.

\begin{table}[6]
Effect     &    The character...
Agony      &    ...is in agony and must overcome her pain to act
Bleeding   &    ...automatically takes a Wound each Combat Turn

Inventory box
-------------

The Inventory box (Figure 16) lists a character's possessions such as Food items, slaved
Prey, and other items.

┌[Inventory]───────────────────────────────┐

Each line in the Inventory box is an Inventory item. Items have an "Edible" radio button
that indicates whether the item is a Food item that can be consumed to reduce Hunger.

Characters can only carry as many items as there are lines in the Inventory box: that is
5 lines, for 5 items.

Description
-----------

Beetles are the armoured knights of the insect kingdom¹. They have an outer pair of wings
modified into a hardened wing-case, the elytra (Greek for "sheaths"), that protect their
delicate flying wings and also, their bodies. Their heads are large and armoured, and
armed with powerful mandibles that can deliver crushing bites. Beetles' heads come in a
wild variety of shapes, sizes and forms, specialised for digging, fighting, or feeding.

The Nests & Insects Beetle character class is modelled after the European rhinoceros
beetle. These beetles' heads are armed with horns that they normally use in mating fights
with other males; in the game, they use them to attack Nests' guardians. They can fly,
but their elytra make them clumsy and slow fliers. They can, however, combine their
flying abiity and their horned head to perform a devastating cannonbal attack that can
strike right at the heart of a swarm.

Beetle characters are adults of their species and do not need to feed: they subsist
during their short lives on the food consumed as larvae. Mechanically speaking, Beetle
characters' Hunger rating is replaced with the word NONE and cannot change with the
consumption of Food items. Beetle characters cannot become Starving. They can, however,
benefit from the effects of Food items such as Nectars or Fungi, thus their Diet is
recorded as "vegetarian" for this purpose only.

feed.

Scorpions are not insects! They are arthropods, like insects, but they belong to their
own taxonomic Class, Arachnida (the Arachnids), along with spiders. Scorpions, like most
Arachnids, have eight legs and a front pair of appendages, their frightful pincers,
specialised to grasp and manipulate, in particular, their food. Scorpions' tails are
armed with their fearful stinger that injects an extremely painful, lethal venom.
Scorpions can move with precision on their eight legs but are slowed down by their tough
exoskeleton that functions as a carapace armour. Nests & Insects Scorpions can use their
excellent Leadership to support their allies in Combat by improving their Disposition.
They can also use their Signalling to perform an aggressive display showcasing their
pincers and stinger in such a fashion as to frighten their enemies and worsen their
Disposition.

Like Scorpions, Spiders are Arachnids- indeed, the Class Arachnida is named after the
Greek name of Spider, *Arachne*. Spiders, like most Arachnids, have eight legs and two
front appendages, called the pedipalps, that function like external mouthparts. Spiders
can move very fast and with great precision on their eight legs. They are frightfully
clever and use their intelligence to hunt and ambush prey. The defining characteristic of
spiders is their ability to weave webs. In Combat, Nests & Insects Spiders' webs can
immobilise enemies or stabilise allies bleeding hemolymph (the web essentially acts as a
bandage). Spiders' bites inject venom that can paralyse prey, and can heal allies,
removing their Wounds. They are, unfortunately quite frail and have no carapace to
protect them from attacks.

Wasps are mean, flying killing machines. Wasps are fast and precise fliers capable of
hovering in place. They have yellow- or orange-and-black aposematic stripes that warn
enemies of their deadlinesss. Their Stings inject lethal venom, but unlike Spiders'
venom, Nests & Insects' Wasp venom can only wound, not heal. Unlike Bees, Wasps do not
lose their stings and die when they sting an enemy, so they can keep stinging away for as
long as they like.

In Nests & Insects Wasps are high-mobility, shock troops optimised for menoeuverability
and damage, but they have soft bodies without a protective carapace armour. They can use
their high Signalling to perform aggessive displays of their death stripes and drain the
morale of their enemies, thus reducing their Disposition. Wasps have good knowledge of
eusocial insects' domains thanks to their high Eusociology, acquired while raiding the
nests of Bees, and tending to their own. They are excellent at Foraging and can identify
valuable or dangerous Food items.

                                         System
                                         ======

This chapter introduces the roleplaying system used in Nests & Insects. For ease of
reference, the system is called Fuzzy d100, shortened to fd100.

fd100 is a percentile system, in the sense that it describes characters in terms of
percentile-valued Features and that the die rolled to determine the success or failure of
characters' actions is the d100, ranging from 00 to 99. Decile dice: the d20, d40, d60,
d80, and the d100 itself, are used to quantify Effects and other Features on the game's
percentile scale. The d40, d60 and d80 are composed of pairs of a polyhedral die: the d4,
d6 and d8, respectively; and a d10, rolled together and read as one - just as the d100 is
composed of two d10 rolled together and read as one.

fd100 is designed to eliminate mental arithmetic from the process used to determine the
outcome of characters' actions ("action resolution"), and to encourage players to use
their imagination to overcome challenges faced by their characters in-game.

To determine the outcome of a character's actions, a player begins by describing the
character's Intent, then rolls a d100 and compares its result to two target numbers,
Effort and Resistance, determined by Features of the character, and enemies or the Nest
environment, respectively. The player wants to roll under Effort and equal to, or over
Resistance. The comparison determines one of four initial Degrees of Success (or Failure)
for the action: Complete Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success or Complete Success,
in order from worst to best.

Modifiers may change the Degree of Success. "Static" modifiers are compared to the
initial d100 Roll. "Dramatic" modifiers are compared each to a new d100 roll. Both types
of modifier can be positive or negative. Rolling under a positive modifier "Shifts Up"
(improves) the Degree of Success; rolling under a negative modifier "Shifts Down"
(worsens) the Degree of Success. A Shift Up changes a Complete Success to a Critical
Success and a Shift Down changes a Complete Failure to a Critical Failure.

Finally, the results of actions may need to be quantified by rolling a decile die. The
Game Queen (GQ) then describes the outcome of the action according to the character's
Intent and the Degree of Success of the action.

                                       ==========

Decile Dice
-----------

The die used to roll for action resolution in fd100 is the "d100". This is nominally a
hundred-sided die, but, in practice, a composite die comprised of two, ten-sided dice
(d10s), numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, which are rolled together and read as one to generate
numbers from 00 to 99.

In Nests & Insects' nomenclature, the d100 is one of five "decile dice": the d20, d40,
d60, d80 and the d100 itself. The d20 is a twenty-sided die with faces numbered 0, 1,
..., 19. The d40, d60, d80 and the d100 are each a pair of polyhedral dice: a d4, d6, d8
and d10, respectively, numbered 0, 1, ..., n-1, where "n" is the number of faces on the
die, and used to generate the "tens" of the roll; and a d10, also numbered 0, 1, ..., 9,
and used to generate the "ones" of the roll.

To generate a result in a decile die's range, the "tens" and "ones" die are rolled
together, the "tens" die is placed to the left of the "ones" die and the numbers showing
on the two dice are read left-to-right, like a printed numeral. The d20 is rolled on its
own and its results read as they come up. This way, each decile die generates numbers in
the range 00 to m-1, where "m" is the number of faces on the decile die. For example, the
d40 decile die has 40 faces and generates results in the range 00 to 39; the d60 decile
die has 60 faces and generates results in the range 00 to 59; and so on.

The d100 is the only die used to determine the Degree of Success of an Action. The other
decile dice (and the d100 itself) are used to quantify the results of Actions on the same
percentile scale as Features. This is particularly the case for Actions that bestow an
Effect on a character or another game entity.

Table 2 in the Section "Decile dice" of the "Overview" Chapter illustrates Decile dice.
The Table is reproduced here for ease of reference:

\begin{table}[4]
Decile die&  Range   &    Tens die &  Numbered  &  Ones die&  Numbered  
d20       &  0 to 19 &    Not any! &            &  d20     &  0,1,...,19
d40       &  0 to 39 &    d4       &  0,1,...,3 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d60       &  0 to 59 &    d6       &  0,1,...,5 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d80       &  0 to 79 &    d8       &  0,1,...,7 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
d100      &  0 to 99 &    d10      &  0,1,...,9 &  d10     &  0,1,...,9 
\end{table}
Table: Decile dice, used for quantification on a percentile scale. d100 is also a decile
die, and the only one used for Action resolution. The d20 does not need a "tens" die and
is rolled on its own.


Implementing Decile Dice
------------------------

While the d20, d4, d6, and d8 are commonly used in TTRPGs and so are easy to find, they
typically have faces numbered 1, 2, ..., n (where "n" is the number of faces of the die).
Let's call such dice "one-based". d10s typically have faces numbered 0, 1, ..., 9 (or 00,
10, ..., 90). Let's call those "zero-based". Accordingly the Nests & Insects polyhedrals
used to compose decile dice are all "zero-based", just like the typical d10. Most
roleplayers will not have zero-based polyhedral dice, other than d10s. What to do then,
to play Nests & Insects? There are four alternatives, listed below.

1. Get you a set of blank polyhedral dice and paint in the desired numbers.

   In that case, you get a blank d20, d4, d6 and d8, and paint their faces with the
   following numbers:

   d20: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

   d4: 0, 1, 2, 3

   d6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

   d8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

   In this case, you can keep using the standard, zero-based d10s as the "tens" for the
   d100 and the "ones" for all other decile dice. The only reason to get a blank d10 is
   to have a full set of zero-based polyhedral dice in the same style. In that case, feel
   free to give the same treatment to the also-standard d12, and, why not, the (rarer,
   but readily available) d14, d16, and d18. Now you have more decile dice: d120, d140,
   d160 and d180. You can even go up to d200! Sooner or later, someone's going to come up
   with a game to use those!

2. Use the standard, one-based polyhedral dice and adjust the decile die roll by
   subtraction.

   In this case, the decile d20 is a one-based, twenty-sided die with faces numbered 1,
   2, ..., 20. When you roll a one-based d20, subtract 1 from the result of the roll to
   generate numbers in the range of a zero-based d20.

   The decile d40, d60 and d80 are composite dice, comprised of a one-based d4, d6 and
   d8, respectively, as the "tens" of the decile die; and a zero-based d10 as the "ones"
   die. To generate a decile die result, roll the "tens" and "ones" dice together, place
   the "tens" die to the left of the "ones" die, and read them left-to-right as before.
   Only this time *subtract 10 from the result* to generate a number in the range of the
   decile die. 


   The d100 doesn't change: it is comprised of two zero-based d10s read side-by-side, and
   generating numbers from 00 to 99.

3. Use the standard, one-based polyhedral dice and interpret the results as if they were
   zero-based.

   In this case, the decile d20 is a one-based, twenty-sided die with faces numbered 1,
   2, ..., 20, as in Alternative 2. When you roll the d20 as a decile die, read a "20" as
   "0". This will give you twenty numbers, from 0 to 19, as the range of the decile d20.

   As in Alternative 2, the decile d40, d60 and d80 are composite dice comprised of a
   one-based d4, d6 and d8, respectively, as the "tens" of the decile die; and a
   zero-based d10 as the "ones". To generate a zero-based decile die result, roll the
   "tens" and "ones" dice together, place the "tens" die to the left of the "ones" die,
   and read them left-to-right as before. Only this time, when the tens die shows its
   highest digit: "4" on a d4, "6" on a d6 and "8" on a d8, read that digit as "0",
   *unless the "ones" d10 also shows a "0"* (in which case you read the highest digit as
   itself).

   As with Alternative 2, the d100 doesn't change and is comprised of two, zero-based
   d10s read side-by-side to generate numbers from 00 to 99.

   For example, in this case, the decile d60 is comprised of a one-based d6 as the "tens"
   die and a zero-based d10 as the "ones" die. When the one-based d6 shows a "6", you
   read it as "0", unless the d10 also shows a "0". Suppose the d6 is showing a "6" and
   the d10 is showing a "5". In that case, the result of the d60 decile die is "05", or
   just "5". Suppose the d6 is showing a "6" and the d10 is showing a "0". In that case,
   the result of the d60 is "60".

4. Use a die-rolling app.

   If you are an avid roleplayer, you probably have one of those on your phone already.

   One downside of this method is a slight risk of distraction when using one's phone in
   the middle of a game.

   Another downside is that you don't get to roll any actual dice. Some of us just like
   the physical sensation of dice clicking soothingly in the palm of the hand!

Nests & Insects' preferred decile die implementation is the one described in Alternative
1, above. Unlike the other alternatives it does not require a special way to read the
dice, as Alternative 3, and it doesn't require mental arithmetic (however simple) as
Alternative 2. Alternative 2 in particular breaks fd100's claim to "eliminate mental
arithmetic" during Action resolution! The best thing with Alternative 1, of course, is
that it makes a perfect excuse to collect even more weird gaming dice.


Six Degrees of Success and Failure
----------------------------------

The "Fuzzy" in the fd100 name alludes to the "fuzzy" action resolution that allows for
six Degrees of Success and Failure (DoS) as the outcome of an action. Those are listed in
the Six Degrees of Success Table below.

\begin{table}[8]
Degree of Success &    Action outcome               &    Determined by
Critical Success  &    Satisfies Intent with reward &    Modifiers
Complete Success  &    Satisfies Intent             &    Qualification Roll
Partial Success   &    Satisfies Intent marginally  &    Qualification Roll
Partial Failure   &    Thwarts Intent marginally    &    Qualification Roll
Complete Failure  &    Thwarts Intent               &    Qualification Roll
Critical Failure  &    Thwarts Intent with penalty  &    Modifiers
\end{table}
Table: Six Degrees of Success

The six DoS are ordered from worst (Critical Failure) to best (Critical Success) with
respect to the outcome of an Action. The exact outcome of an Action, such as rewards or
penalties on a Critical Success or Failure, depends on the Intent of the character
attempting an Action, and the context of the Action, for example whether it's taken
during a minigame in which case the outcome of the Action is defined by the rules of the
minigame. Intent is described in the "Describing Intent" Section and minigames in the
"Minigames" Section, both later in this Chapter.

Four of the DoS listed in the Table are determined by the result of an initial
Qualification Roll (described in the "Qualification" Section) compared to Effort and
Resistance. Two additional DoS can be achieved by the use of modifiers. Modifiers can
make the DoS indicated by the Qualification Roll better or worse, by conferring a Shift
Up or Down the DoS ordering (from worst to best, or bottom to top on the Table).
Modifiers and DoS Shifts are described in the "Modification" Section.

\newpage

Percentile Features
-------------------

\begin{box}[Rule Summaries]
Throughout this Chapter you will find text boxes summarising definitions and rules.
Rules Summary 1, below, summarises Features.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 1: fd100 Features]
A Feature is a game variable that describes a game entity. A Feature has a unique
identifier, its "name" and can take a value in the percentile range [1,100], its
"rating". Nests & Insects Feature names are usually single-word descriptors. A
Feature's name describes a property, ability or condition of the character. A
Feature's rating represents the chance that a character will succeed at a task or
overcome a condition described by the Feature's name. Exceptionally, the Wounds
Feature is a simple count and its rating is an integer. The ratings of Features other
than Wounds are used as the Effort and Resistance values in die rolls.
\end{box}

In fd100, game entities such as characters, enemy creatures and Rooms in Nests are
defined in terms of their "Features". Features are game variables with a unique
identifier, and a value in the percentile range from 1 to 100.

In Nests & Insects the unique identifier of a Feature is usually a single-word descriptor
that we call the Feature's "name". A Feature's percentile value is its "rating".

Features represent important properties, or abilities, of a character, something that a
character is, or can do, or a condition affecting the character.

Features' percentile ratings represent the chance that the character will successfully
carry out a task relevant to the Feature's name, or the chance that she can overcome a
condition.

The exception to percentile Feature ratings is the Wounds Feature that measures physical
injury acquired by characters usually during Combat. The value of the Wounds Feature is
always an integer, normally in the low tens, and interpreted as a simple count of the
wounds inflicted on a character.

Percentile Features' ratings are used as the Effort and Resistance values for die rolls
made to determine the outcome of characters' actions. Wounds' counts are never used as
Effort or Resistance.

Nests & Insects Features are grouped in different categories such as Attributes, Combat
Conditions, Effects, etc. The "Character Sheet" chapter briefly describes the different
categories of character Features. Complete descriptions of the Features of characters and
enemies, and their use in the game, are given in the Chapters "Character", and "Setting".

                                     Taking Actions
                                     ==============

Action resolution steps
-----------------------

Players' characters can take actions to achieve their goals within the context of
minigames, and without. Actions are resolved in up to eight steps, summarised below and
discussed in detail in the following sections.

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 2: Action Resolution]

1. Intent: Describe the character's intent.

2. Effort and Resistance: Decide which Features to use as Effort and Resistance.

3. Qualification: Roll a d100 and compare it to Effort and Resistance.

4. Degree of Success: Determine the Degree of Success or Failure (DoS) of the Action.

5. Modification: Apply modifiers. The DoS may Shift up or Down and become Critical.

7. Quantification: Roll a decile die to quantify the results of the Action.

8. Resolution: Describe the outcome of the Action.

\end{box}

Not all of the above steps are necessary to resolve all Actions. For instance, some
Actions may require Quantification, but others may not; modifiers may apply to some
Actions but not others; etc.

_Terminology_ gaming terms like "Qualification", "Modification", "Degree of Success" and
so on are used for easy reference to important game concepts. You do not have to learn
them by heart.

\newpage

Describing Intent
-----------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 3: Intent]
An Action begins with a description of the character's Intent. The description must
be sufficiently detailed to help determine the Features to be used as Effort and
Resistance, or modifiers, for the Action. Minigame rules define the Intent of
formulaic minigame Actions and the Features to use as Effort, Resistance and
modifiers for such Actions.
\end{box}

A player begins resolving a character's Action by describing the character's Intent: why
or how the character is acting, what she hopes to achieve. This description can be as
elaborate or simple as the character, and the player group, feel like.

The only requirement is that the description of the character's Intent is sufficiently
detailed for the GQ to be able to determine the Features to be used as Effort and
Resistance, or modifiers.

\begin{box}[Example 2]
Cody declares his character's intent: "Spider attacks the second Nasute Soldier".
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Example 3]
Brody declares his character's intent: "I want Wasp to display her stripes and scare
the living beejeesus out of the Worker Bees! I want her to dive in towards them,
buzzing menacingly and waving her abdomen around in, like, a threatening and
provocative manner! I want them to run away screaming from buzzing, venomous DEATH!
BzzZZZzzZZZZzz!"
\end{box}

Both styles illustrated in Examples 1 and 2 are fine, as far as the game rules are
concerned. It doesn't matter that Bees cannot scream and won't run away.

In Example 1 it is clear that Cody's character is attacking. His character is acting
either during Combat, or just before Combat begins, so the Effort and Resistance should
be Spider's Threat Rate and the Nasute Soldier's Survival Rate, as determined by the
Combat minigame.

In Example 2, Brody is clearly describing the use of Wasp's Flying and Signalling to
perform an aggressive display with the purpose of scaring the Worker Bees. Effort is
Wasp's Signalling and Resistance is most likely the Bees' Passions. Wasp's Flying can be
used as a static modifier, or as a dramatic modifier, or ignored.

\newpage

Effort and Resistance
---------------------

Effort and Resistance are the two target numbers for the Qualification Roll that
determines the initial DoS of an Action.

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 4: Effort]
Effort represents the character's effort to achieve her Intent, as described by the
player. The value of Effort is equal to one of the acting character's Features that
is most appropriate for the attempted Action, according to the Feature's name.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 5: Resistance]
Resistance represents the resistance of game entities to the character's Action. The
value of Resistance is equal to an appropriate Feature of an enemy creature, or of
the Nest's environment, or any game entity opposing the character's Intent.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 6: Choosing Effort and Resistance]
The description of the character's Intent informs the selection of Features used as
Effort and Resistance. Minigame rules define the Features to use as Effort and
Resistance for formulaic minigame Actions with predefined Intent.
\end{box}

_Minigame Actions_ If the Action is taking place during a minigame, and it is one of the
minigame's formulaic Actions, the minigame rules will define a formula that determines
Effort and Resistance Features.

_Other Actions_ If the Action is taking place outwith a minigame, or a minigame does not
define a formula for the attempted Action, the player and the GQ together decide what
Features are best used as Effort and Resistance. Use Features' names and descriptions
and apply gaming sense. Usually, the GQ will suggest a relevant pair of Features. The
player is free to negotiate a different pair but the GQ has the final word. Any
negotiation should not take as long as to bore the rest of the group.

\begin{box}[Example 4]
Cody negotiates with the GQ: "But Wasp is Venomous so she can display her Stinger and
maximise the intimidation of the Minor Termite Soldiers".
\end{box}

In Example 4 Cody is negotiating the use of Wasp's Venomous: 80% Specific Abiliy as
Effort to an Action with intent to intimidate some Termite Soldiers. Normally, an Action
with this Intent would use a character's Signalling Feature as Effort. Wasp's Signalling
is 68% which is already pretty good, but Cody wants to maximise the chance to intimidate
the Termites. It's up to the GQ whether to accept this or not. If the GQ decides that
Signalling is the appropriate Feature to use as Effort, so it is.

Qualification
-------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 7: Qualification Roll]
To make a Qualification Roll means to roll a d100 and compare it to Effort and
Resistance, simultaneously. To roll under Effort is to achieve or "match" Effort. To
roll over, or equal to, Resistance is to overcome, or "beat" Resistance.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 8: Degree of Success and Failure]
If the Qualification Roll matches Effort, then the DoS of the Action is a "Success";
otherwise, it is a "Failure". If the Qualification Roll beats Resistance, then the
DoS of the Action is a "Complete" Success, or a "Partial" Failure; otherwise it is a
Complete Failure, or a Partial Success.
\end{box}

Once Effort and Resistance are chosen the player rolls a d100 and compares its result to
Effort and Resistance. This is called a "Qualification Roll". To achieve the best outcome
in a Qualification Roll the player wants to roll under Effort, and over or equal to
Resistance. The former is to "match" Effort and the latter is to "beat" Resistance.

The result of the d100 roll relative to Effort and Resistance determines four initial
Degrees of Success or Failure: Complete Failure, Partial Failure, Partial Success or
Complete Success, in order from worst to best for the purpose of satisfying the
character's Intent. The four initial Degrees of Success and Failure are summarised in the
Degree of Success Table below.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Effort&       Roll beats Resistance&       Degree of Success
True               &       True                 &       Complete Succes
True               &       False                &       Partial Success
False              &       True                 &       Partial Failure
False              &       False                &       Complete Failure
\end{table}
Table: Degree of Success.

_Possible Degrees of Success_ Not all Degrees of Success and Failure are possible to
achieve just with a Qualification Roll. If Effort is lower than or equal to Resistance,
Complete Success is not possible. If Effort is higher than Resistance, Complete Failure
is not possible. All six DoS, including Critical Success and Critical Failure are only
achievable through the use of modifiers, described in the "Modification" Section,
following.

\newpage

Modification
------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 9: Static and Dramatic Modifiers]
Modifiers change the DoS of an Action. There are two types of modifiers: static and
dramatic. Static modifiers are compared to the d100 result of the Qualification roll.
For each dramatic modifier a new d100 roll is made and the dramatic modifier compared
to the result of the roll.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 10: Positive and Negative Modifiers]
Modifiers can be positive or negative. Matching a positive modifier confers a Shift
Up to the Dos. Failiing to beat a negative modifier confers a Shift Down to the DoS.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 11: Shifts Up and Shifts Down]
A Shift Up changes the DoS from worse to better. A Shift Down changes the DoS from
better to worse. A Shift Up from Complete Success changes the DoS to Critical
Success. A Shift Down from Complete Failure changes the DoS to Critical Failure.
\end{box}

Modifiers are Features of a character or game entities that further support or hinder the
character's Actions, in addition to Effort and Resistance. Like Effort and Resistance,
what modifiers apply to an Action depends on the character's Intent, as described by the
player or defined by a minigame formula.

There are two types of modifiers: static modifiers and dramatic modifiers. Both can be
either positive or negative. Static modifiers are compared to the d100 result of the
Qualification Roll. Dramatic modifiers are each compared to a new d100 roll.

In mechanical terms, modifiers confer Shifts Up or Down to the DoS of an Action, after it
is determined by an initial Qualification Roll. A Shift moves the DoS up or down, from
worst to best. The Changes to DoS by the use of modifiers are summarised in the Table
below.

\begin{table}[8]
D100 Roll...    &       Modifier Sign&       Change to DoS
Matches Modifier&       Positive     &       Shift Up
Beats Modifier  &       Positive     &       No change
Matches Modifier&       Negative     &       Shift Down
Beats Modifier  &       Negative     &       No change
\end{table}
Table: Modifiers and change to DoS.

\newpage

Choosing modifiers
------------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 12: The Rule of Two]
At most two dramatic modifiers may be applied to a single Action: either a) two
positive, or b) two negative, or c) one positive and one negative.
\end{box}

Static modifiers model routine complications to ordinary Actions, in particular minigame
Actions. Dramatic modifiers model uncommon or surprising variation to Actions. 

Static modifiers are usually defined by minigame formulae. Dramatic modifiers might be
proposed by a player and are ultimately granted by the GQ. The GQ should grant a dramatic
modifier when a character takes an Action that is high-stakes, spectacular, or
unexpected, or impresses and surprises the group in some other way. In other words:
dramatic modifiers should apply when it is dramatically appropriate to take additional
information into account that might change the course of the game.

No more than two dramatic modifiers may be applied to a single Action: either two
positive or two negative, or one of each sign. This is in the interest of reducing the
number of rolls needed to resolve an Action. Static modifiers are compared to the result
of the Qualification roll, and do not need a separate roll, therefore there is no
restriction to the number of static modifiers that can apply to an Action.

Dramatic modifiers should be used sparingly, in special circumstances. As a rough rule of
thumb, the GQ should grant no more than two or three dramatic modifiers per game session.

\newpage

Quantification
--------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 13: Quantification Roll]
To make a Quantification Roll means to roll a decile die and change the rating of a
Feature according to the result. There are three types of Quantification Roll: a Roll
to Set, a Roll to Increase, and a Roll to Decrease, the value of a Feature.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 14: Roll to Set]
To make a Quantification Roll to set the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die and
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 15: Roll to Increase]
To make a Quantification Roll to increase the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die
and compare it to the rating of the Feature. If the result of the roll is higher,
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 16: Roll to Decrease]
To make a Quantification Roll to decrease the rating of a Feature, roll a decile die
and compare it to the rating of the Feature. If the result of the roll is lower,
change the rating of the Feature to the result of the decile die.
\end{box}

A Quantification Roll is made to quantify the results of an Action. Invariably, the
Quantification Roll modifies the rating of a Feature of a character, an enemy, or the
Nest environment. The rating of the Feature is directly set to the value of the
Quantification Roll, without addition or subtraction, as summarised in Rules Summaries
17-19.

If the results of an Action need to be quantified, this will be explicitly stated in the
rules: either the rules of a minigame, or the description of a Feature. The GQ may also
decide that an Action needs quantification.

A Quantification Roll is only made after the Modification step of Action resolution, when
the final DoS of an Action is known. This is because the decile die to roll will usually
depend on the DoS of the Action.

\newpage

Resolution
----------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 17: Outcome description]
The outcome of Actions is described by the GQ.
\end{box}

Once the Qualification roll is made, the final DoS of the Action is known, Action results
are Quantified and Features' ratings are changed as necessary, the GQ describes the
outcome of the Action.

_The role of the GQ_ The GQ's responsibility is to be the eyes and ears of the players in
the game world and the only interface between the players and their characters. Only what
the GQ describes, actually happens in the game world. In that sense, the role of the GQ
is that of a benevolent dictator: she has absolute authority over the game world, but she
must ensure that the game is worthwhile for the entire group.

\newpage

                                    Simplified Rolls
                                    ================

Boolean Roll
------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 18: Boolean Roll]
To make a Boolean Roll describe the character's Intent and choose Effort as for a
Qualification Roll, then roll d100 and compare the result to Effort. If the result of
the d100 roll matches Effort, the attempted Action Succeeds. Otherwise, it Fails.
\end{box}

A Boolean Roll is a simpler form of the Qualification Roll that only determines Success
or Failure, without any finer gradation. Only an Effort value need be chosen to make
a Boolean roll- neither Resistance, nor modifiers are taken into account.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Feature&        Action Outcome
True                &        Success       
False               &        Failure       
\end{table}
Table: Boolean Roll

A Boolean Roll may be called for by the rules of minigames. For example, the Combat
minigame calls for a Boolean Roll to determine a character's starting Disposition at the
start of Combat, or to resist an Effect for a Turn.

The GQ may also call for a Boolean Roll when the complexity of determining the full Six
Degrees of Success and Failure of a Qualification Roll with modifiers is not justified by
the context of the Action, or when it is not clear from the context of an Action what the
difference is between different DoS.

\begin{box}[Example 5]
Beetle is trying to lift a piece of debris from the Nest's floor. This is a simple
Action that can either succeed or fail. The GQ asks for a Boolean Roll against
Beetle's Strength: 55%. The player rolls: 78. The result does not match Beetle's
Strength so Beetle fails to lift the piece of debris from the floor.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Note 1]
In percentile systems the Boolean Roll is more often known as as a "Skill Check" or
"Test". Nests & Insects calls it a "Boolean Roll" to distinguish its crisp, binary
determination of success and Failure from the "fuzzy" one of the Qualification Roll.
Unfortunately, the alternative "Crisp Roll" was not thematically appropriate.
\end{box}


Contested Boolean Roll
----------------------

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 19: Contested Boolean Roll]
To make a Contested Boolean Roll describe the character's Intent and choose Effort
and Resistance as for a Qualification Roll, then roll d100 and compare the result to
Effort and Resistance simultaneously. If the result of the d100 roll matches Effort
and beats Resistance, the attempted Action Succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.
\end{box}

A Contested Boolean Roll is a Boolean Roll that also takes into account the Resistance of
a game entity to a character's Effort, but like the ordinary Boolean Roll, only
determines Success or Failure, without any degrees thereof.

\begin{table}[8]
Roll matches Effort &   Roll beats Resistance &   Action Outcome
True                &   True                  &   Success       
True                &   False                 &   Failure
False               &   True                  &   Failure      
False               &   False                 &   Failure       
\end{table}
Table: Contested Boolean Roll

Unlike the Boolean Roll, the Contested Boolean Roll is not called for by any minigames.
It's up to the GQ to decide when a Contested Boolean Roll is the preferred option. The
main use of the Contested Boolean Roll is to simplify the resolution of Actions where
it makes sense to take into account the Resistance to a character's Effort, but where the
full complexity of the Six Degrees of Success of the Qualification Roll is not needed.

\begin{box}[Example 6]
Beetle is trying to lift a piece of debris from the Nest's floor. The GQ asks the
Beetle player for a Contested Boolean Roll. Effort is Beetle's Strength: 55%, and
Resistance is 45%, because the GQ determines the piece of debris is not too heavy.
The Beetle player rolls: 15. That matches Beetle's Effort but does not beat
Resistance. The Action outcome is a Failure and Beetle cannot lift the debris.
\end{box}

\begin{box}[Note 2]
The outcome of a Contested Boolean Roll can only be Success when Effort is higher
than Resistance. When Resistance is equal to, or higher than Effort, the Action can
only fail. In that case, either don't make any rolls at all, or make a full
Qualification Roll or a simple Boolean Roll instead.
\end{box}

\newpage

                                      Minigames
                                      =========

Nests & Insects is organised around four "minigames". A minigame is a set of special
rules for a special game situation that Nests & Insects wants to model with more detail
than the standard fd100 rules. Combat is the most detailed and elaborate of Nests &
Insects' minigames. The other three are Survival and Exploration; Hunting and Foraging;
and Resting and Healing. Brief descriptions are listed below.

* The Combat minigame defines rules for, well, combat between the players' characters and
  a Nest's denizens.

* The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for characters to explore, and the
  GQ to roll the dice to procedurally generate, a Nest.

* The Hunting and Foraging minigame defines rules for finding sustenance and medicinal
  Food items.

* The Resting and Healing minigame defines rules for healing from wounds and Effects,
  consuming food Items to reduce Hunger, and using XP to improve characters' Features.

\newpage

Minigame Formulaic Actions
--------------------------

Each minigame is characterised by a set of standard Actions that characters typically
take during the circumstances modelled by the minigame. For example, during Combat,
characters typically attack enemies. Such Actions are a minigame's "formulaic" Actions.

Minigames define each of their formulaic Actions by means of a Formula that includes at
least a listing of Effort, Resistance and modifier Features and a table listing the
outcome of a formulaic Action for each DoS of a Qualification Roll. The Minigame Formula
Template figure below illustrates the template used to define minigame formulae.

Name of the Minigame: ............... (The minigame that defines this formula)
Participating Entities: ............. (Characters, enemies or other game entities)

Combat Summary
--------------

Combat begins when the characters and a group of enemies attack one another. Combat is
divided into Rounds, divided into Turns in which characters and enemies participating in
Combat (Combatants) get to act, and players and the GQ roll dice to decide the outcome of
Combatants' Actions.

At the start of Combat, before the first Round, Combatants' starting Disposition and
Initiative Order are decided, then the first Round begins and Combatants take Turns in
order of their Initiative. Combatants can take Actions out of Turn for example to
Suppress an enemy or Support an ally, or Resist an Effect.

Players decide their characters' Actions and the GQ decides the actions of enemies.

The goal of Combat Actions is to inflict Wounds or bestow detrimental Effects on enemies
in order to kill them, or reduce their effectiveness in Combat, or reduce their
Disposition until they are Retreating.

Wounds cause the DoS of all subsequent Combat Actions to Shift Down. Reduced Disposition
similarly imposes negative modifiers to subsequent Actions. Once a character or enemy's
Disposition reaches Retreating the Combatant cannot take Actions other than fleeing form
Combat. If a Combatant's Wounds reach or exceed the maximum marked on her sheet, the
Combatant is killed.

Combat ends when all Combatants on one side are either killed, or Retreating.

\newpage

Combat Steps
------------

The Combat minigame plays out in nine Steps, two of which repeat until Combat ends. The
nine Combat Steps are summarised in Rules Summary 20, below, and discussed in detail in
the following Sections.

\begin{box}[Rules Summary 20: Combat Steps]

1. Determine Combat participants (Combatants) and the Sides they fight on.

2. Determine all Combatants' starting Disposition.

3. Determine Combatants' Initiative Order.

4. A new Combat Round begins.

5. A new Combat Turn begins.

6. The next Combatant in the Initiative Order takes a Turn.

7. Repeat from Step 5 until all Combatants have taken a Turn, or passed.

8. Repeat from Step 4 until all Combatants on one side of Combat are killed, or
   Retreating.

9. Combat Ends.

\end{box}

\newpage

Determine Combatants and Sides
------------------------------

Combat begins when either the characters, or Nest creatures attack one another. 

All characters in the Room where Combat is taking place make up one Side of Combat.

All creatures of the same species as the creature attacking or attacked by the characters
and in the same Room as that creature make up the other Side of Combat.

Characters or creatures on the same Side are "allies" and those on the opposite Side are
"enemies".

All the creatures on the two Sides of Combat are Combatants for the duration of Combat.

\newpage

Starting Disposition
--------------------

Before the start of the first Combat Round each player makes a Boolean Roll against their
character's Initiative, and the GQ similarly makes a Boolean Roll against Initiative for
each of the enemies. Each Combatant whose Initiative roll is Successful starts Combat in
Holding Disposition. Each Combatant whose Initiative roll is Failud, starts Combat in
Recoiling Disposition.

\begin{table}[8]
Initiative Roll Result &    Starting Disposition
Success                &    Holding
Failure                &    Recoiling
\end{table}
Table: Starting Disposition

\newpage

Initiative Order
----------------

Before the start of the first Combat Round and after Starting Disposition is determined,
the GQ decides the Initiative Order for all Combatants.

Combatants take Turns in order of their Initiative. The Combatant with the highest
Initiative Order takes the first Turn, the one with the next highest Initiative Order
takes the second Turn, and so on.

Initiative Order is determined as follows:

* For each Combatant, their Initiative Order is equal to their Initiative rating.

* If two Combatants are tied for Initiative, the Combatant with the most advanced
  Disposition (closest to Charging) takes a Turn before the other Combatants.

* If two or more Combatants are still tied after Initiative and Disposition are compared,
  the GQ rolls a die or flips a coin to break the tie.

The die to roll to break ties depends on the number of Combatants tied for Initiative: if
there are two Combatants tied, flip a coin. If there are three, roll a d6 divided by two.
If there are four, roll a d4. And so on.

\newpage

Combat Rounds
-------------

Once Initiative Order is determined the first Round of Combat begins and Combatants take
Actions in Turn, in order of Initiative.

Combatants can take up to three Actions per Round: 

* one Tactical Action which can be an Attack, Suppress or Support Action;

* one Resistance Action; 

* and one Manoeuver Action. 

Characters can pass the chance to take any or all of their three Actions, or take one or
two additional Manoeuver Actions in place of their other two Actions.

_Acting out of Turn_ Combatants can forfeit their Turn to take a Tactical Action in an
ally or opponent's Turn. The timing of Actions in a Round is clarified below.

During a combat Round a Combatant can:

* In her Turn, take an Attack Action targeting an enemy.

* In her Turn, take a Suppress Action targeting an enemy.

* In an ally's Turn, take a Support Action targeting that ally.

* In any Turn, before taking another Action, take a Resistance Action targeting one
  Effect she is subject to.

* In her Turn, take a Manoeuver Action.

/*
_Deferring a Turn_ Combatants can delay their Actions to a Turn in the Round after their
own in the Turn Order. The player declares that her character is deferring her Turn, or
"waiting" or something similar. Later in the Round, when it is the Turn of another
character or enemy the player can declare that her character will now take her deferred
Turn. Her character then takes a Turn and the character whose Turn it was originally
takes the Turn after that. 
*/

\newpage

Attack Action
-------------

In her Turn, a Combatant can take one Attack Action targeting an enemy with her Base or
Special Attack. The DoS of the Attack determines which Attack Hits or Misses.

To determine the outcome of an Attack make a Qualification Roll with Effort equal to the
Attacker's Threat Rate and Resistance equal to the target's Survival Rate. If the target
has nonzero Flying or Carapace, they are used as static modifiers to the Roll.

Following is the Combat minigame formula for the Attack Action.

Name of the Minigame ................ Combat
Participating Entities .............. Characters, Enemies
List of Minigame Intents ............ Kill, Hurt, Injure, Rout
List of Minigame Actions ............ Attack
Effort Variables .................... Threat Rate
Resistance Variables ................ Survival Rate
Modifier Variables .................. Carapace, Flying

Outcomes of the six Degrees of Success and Failure:

\begin{table}[12]
Degree of Success &    Outcome
Critical Success  &    Base and Special Attacks Hit
Complete Success  &    Special Attack Hits
Partial Success   &    Base Attack Hits
Partial Failure   &    Base Attack Misses
Complete Failure  &    Special Attack Misses
Critical Failure  &    Base and Special Attacks Miss
\end{table}

_Carapace_ If an Attack has keywords Crushing, Piercing or Shredding and the target has
Carapace > 0%, the target's Carapace rating is a negative static modifier to the Attack
Roll.

_Flying_ If the target of an Attack has Flying > 0%, the target's Flying rating is a
negative, static modifier to the Attack Roll. Additionally, Close range Attacks can only
target a Combatant with Flying > 0% if the attacker also has Flying > 0%. 

_Targeting allies_ Spider's Base and Special Attacks have an Alternative Hit result that
can heal, or remove Bleeding from an Ally. Spider can target an ally with her Attack.
\newpage

Suppress Action
---------------

In an enemy's Turn, a Combatant can take the following Suppress Actions:

1. Attempt to confuse an enemy: roll Smarts vs. Ken to bestow a Confused Effect.

2. Attempt to charm an enemy: roll Charms vs. Passions to bestow a Charmed Effect.

3. Attempt to intimidate an enemy: roll Signalling vs. Passions to Shift Disposition
   Down.

Following is the Combat minigame Formula for the Suppress Action.

Support Action
--------------

In an ally's Turn, a Combatant can take the following Support Actions.

1. Attempt to rally the ally, if the ally is Retreating: roll Leadership vs. Passions.

2. Attempt to encouarge the ally to improve her Disposition: roll Leadership vs.
   Passions. The ally must not be Retreating.

3. Attempt to focus a Confused ally's mind: roll Smarts vs. the ally's Confused.
 
4. Attempt to snap a Charmed ally out of it: roll Charms vs the ally's Charmed.

\end{table}

\newpage

Manoeuver Action
----------------

Manoeuver Actions provide a mechanism for players' characters and enemies controlled by
the GQ to take improvised actions, outside of the formulaic Actions of the Combat
minigame. For this reason there are no special rules for Manoeuver Actions and no
minigame formula for them. The GQ must come up with special rules on the fly.

To take a Manoeuver Action, describe the Combatant's Intent, then choose Effort and
Resistance, and resolve the Action with a Qualification Roll, a Boolean Roll, or a
Contested Boolean Roll, as described in Chapter "fd100". Feel free to add a
Quantification Roll and bestow an Effect as a result of a Manoeuver. Any of a Combatant's
Features can be used to take a Manoeuver Action. Below are some example Manoeuvers:

* Lift an enemy off the ground and throw her behind her allies' lines: roll Strength vs.
  the enemy's Stamina. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy loses one Turn of combat.

* Lift an enemy off the ground, carry her, flying, behind her allies lines and drop her
  there: Roll Flying + Strength vs. the enemy's Stamina. If the Roll succeeds, the enemy
  acquires Stunned: d40.

* Direct an ally to hit an enemy where she has been previously wounded: Roll Ken +
  Signalling vs. the enemy's Smarts. If the Action succeeds, the ally gets a positive
  static modifier to her next Attack. Roll d40 to Quantify the modifier.

* Give an enemy the old run-around: Roll Speed vs. Speed to evade an enemy taking an
  Attack Action targeting the character. If the Roll Succeeds, the enemy's Turn is
  postponed until the end of the Round.

* Bash together a barrier to protect the character and her allies: Make a Boolean Roll
  vs. Construction or Web Weaving. If the Roll succeeds, the character and one ally can
  take cover behind the barrier, and the next Ranged Attack targeting them has a -30%
  static negative modifier. After an Attack targets the characters behind the barrier,
  the barrier is destroyed.

\begin{box}[Houseruling Manoeuvers]
Manoeuvers are an opportunity for players to use their imagination to come up with
creative ways to gain an advantage in Combat, or for the GQ to use hers to create
interesting and challenging situations for the players to overcome. A character's
Intent, as described by her player, should guide the GQ to "houserule" the
character's Actions. Accordingly the GQ should not hesitate to play the Nest's
guardians as more than dumb automata, who can also use their (simple) insectoid
brains to protect their home.

Breaking from Combat
--------------------

A Combatant can Break from (leave) Combat at any time, as a Manoeuver Action. This is the
only Manoeuver Action that gets its own rule.

To have a Combatant Break from Combat, make a Boolean Roll with the character's
Initiative as Effort. If the Roll succeeds, the character or enemy is no longer in Combat
and can take Actions other than formulaic Combat Actions, as usual. If the Roll fails,
the Combatant remains a Combatant. She is free to try again in her next Turn.

Consuming Food in Combat
------------------------

There is no formulaic Combat Action that allows a Combatant to consume a Food item during
Combat. War is no picnic! Combatants are also not allowed to consume Food as a Manoeuver!

If a player or the GQ wishes a character or enemy to consume a Food Item, the Combatant
must first Break from Combat.

Joining Combat
--------------

A creature who is not in Combat can always Join Combat. The creature may have Broken from
Combat previously, or she may not have been in the same Room as her friends when Combat
began. It doesn't really matter: a creature can always join Combat.

Joining Combat requires no roll. A creature who is not a Combatant joins Combat at the
start of the next Combat Round, after a player or the GQ declares that the character or
enemy is joining Combat. At the start of that Round, before any Combatants' Turn,
determine the new Combatant's Disposition and Initiative Order, then she takes her first
Turn in Initiative Order, as normal.

\begin{box}[Note 3]
A common reason for new Combatants to join Combat is when the Nest's Guardians summon
their conspecifics to help them repell the intruders. In that case, when the summoned
allies arrive, they Join Combat as described above.
\end{box}

\newpage

Combat Ends
-----------

When Combat ends, all Combatants cease to be Combatants and the two Sides cease to
exist for rules purposes.

Nothing else worthy of note happens at the end of Combat.

                              Survival and Exploration
                              ========================

The Survival and Exploration minigame defines rules for the procedural generation of a
Nest's environment. During the Survival and Exploration minigame, characters explore the
Nest, while players and the GQ roll dice to determine what the characters find.

Note that Procedural Generation also takes place during the Hunting and Foraging
minigame. However, in order for Hunting and Foraging to be initiated, the characters must
first explore the Nest by means of the Survival and Exploration minigame.

In Nests & Insects procedural generation is an abstraction: no floor plans or maps are
generated. Instead what is generated are game entities that include the spaces inside the
Nests, the creatures that roam them, items that populate them- and their Features.

How Procedural Generation Works
-------------------------------

The core mechanic of procedural generation is "rolling on tables". No, that is not to be
taken literally. It means that the players or the GQ roll a d100 and cross-reference the
result with the rows of a table. The table lists what the characters find and what
happens to them while they explore the Nest.

Survival and Exploration starts with an Exploration Action. This is a full Qualification
Action and its outcomes determine the types, and numbers, of Events that occur as the
characters explore the Nest. There are three types of Events: Costs, Risks and Rewards.
Any Exploration Action may cause up to three Events to occur. A better DoS to the
Exploration Action causes more Rewards to occur while a worse one causes more Costs and
Risks to occur.

Once the type and number of Events is determined, the players roll on the relevant Event
tables (i.e. the Costs, Risks, and Rewards tables) to find which specific Event occurs.
This roll is a Boolean Roll, where the target number is the Chance for the Event to occur
(it doesn't make sense to call this target number an "Effort" as in ordinary Boolean
Rolls). Some Events may also require a Quantification roll to quantify their Features.

The Chance for an Event to occur is determined by two values: one is a base Chance listed
in the corresponding Event table; the other is the rating of the Nest Level on which the
characters are currently located. In some cases a Feature of the exploring Character may
be used as the base Chance for an Event to occur, instead. Nest Levels also define the
Decile Dice to roll for Quantification of the three kinds of Events and their Features.
\newpage

Nest Levels
-----------

A Nest is an environment that consists of multiple Nest Levels, each comprised of
multiple Rooms, and Passages connecting Rooms. 

A Nest Level is a group of Rooms connected by Passages and situated in about the same
distance from the ground, much like a floor in a multi-storey house. 

In mechanical terms, Levels have a percentile rating that is used as the Resistance to
Exploration Actions. As the characters delve deeper into the Nest, the Nest Level of the
Rooms they visit increases. With it, the chance for Cost and Risk Events to occur
increases, and the chance for Reward Events to occur decreases. When the Nest Level
reaches 100% the location of the target of the current Job is found and the characters
can attempt to fulfill the terms of their contract.

\begin{box}[Note 4]
Remember that the players' characters do not visit a Nest to loot. Rather, they are
hired to carry out a Job. Accordingly, Rewards they find during Exploration are not
treasures and richess, rather they are things that help the characters get their Job
done.
\end{box}

Rooms
-----

Rooms are represented as Rewards and are only generated (i.e. found) when a character
takes an Exploration Action. Rooms have Features such as their Area, Height, or Darkness,
that require Quantification.

Room Featurs are only quantified when characters must interact with them. For example,
Height affects the ability of a character to Fly, so it is only Quantified when a
character actually attempts to Fly. Nests & Insects calls this "Just-in-Time" (JIT)
generation.

JIT generation is also used to generate Costs, Risks and Rewards (including Rooms).  In
particular, Costs are only generated when a character enters a Room, while Risks and
Rewards are generated everytime a character takes an Exploration, Hunting, or Foraging
Action (in other words, when a character is searching for something, and there is a
chance that they might find it).

                                        --------

Termites are detritivores: they feed on rotting plant matter, wood and leaves. They make
their nests underground, by borrowing into wood, or by building above-ground structures
with soil and plant matter bound with their feces. Well, yes. Termite nests are connected
to networks of underground tunnels that are used to forage in safety. In Nests & Insects
Termite Nests are gigagntic Cathedrals extending to many meters above and below ground.

Termites are orgranised into castes, most of them without reproductive ability or organs,
and without wings or eyes. Termite life is hard but the Nest thrives. The worker caste
forage and tend to the Nest and the other castes. The Soldier caste protects the nest,
willingly sacrificing its life. The two reproductive castes, the King and Queen, are
responsible for making sure the Nest is always full of millions of Termites of all
castes.

\newpage

Worker Termite
--------------

Worker Termites are unarmed and blind, and cannot fight, but they are numerous, swarm,
and will raise the alarm as soon as they become aware that the Nest has been breached.
Workers raise the alarm by bumping into each other and causing each other to release
alarm pheromones. The pheromone trail spreads throughout the nest attracting more workers
and, soon enough, soldiers. Attacking a swarm of workers causes them to release alarm
pheromones faster.
% TODO: that last bit is missing a rule.

Minor Termite Soldier - Autothyte
---------------------------------

Minor Termite Soldiers are about as big as Worker Termites, but can fight and form
swarms. Like Ants, they don't suffer wound penalties and are blind. They cannot fly. In
Combat they attack intruders by grabbing them with their mandibles and attempting to
crush them. When their Special Attack hits, they explode and spread a sticky liquid that
immobilises enemies caught in it. To be clear: the attack kills the Soldier (but only the
one that actually exploded- its friends soldier on; mechanically speaking that means the
Soldiers lose one wound).

Autothyte Soldiers do not set upon enemies directly, rather they stand in place in
front of their tunnels and attempt to stop intruders from entering the tunnels. When
an Autothyte Soldier's Special Attack fires, there is a 60% chance that the tunnel
entrance that it is guarding will be blocked by the sticky substance secreted during
the attack, and become impassable.

The Major Termite Soldier is a larger, stronger version of the Minor Soldier, but also
rarer. In mechanical terms, Major Autothye Soldiers have more powerful versions of the
Minor Soldiers' Attacks and do not swarm.

Nasute Soldier
--------------

Nasute Soldiers have an elongated snout in place of the large crushing mandibles of other
Soldier termites. In Combat, Nasutes eject from this snout a noxious liquid that
immobilises intruders and can kill them just with the force of the blow. This is called a
Fontanellar Gun. While Nasutes are blind as other worker and soldier termites, they are
wicked shots with their Fontanellar Guns and can hit targets at Long range. Nasutes can
fire their Fontanellar Guns repeatedly even though it tears off the lower part of their
modified mandibles.

\begin{box}[Special Rule - Alarm Gun]

The ejecta of the Nasutes' Fontanellar Gun include an alarm pheromone that compels
other Nasutes in the vicinity of a Gun's discharge to fire their own, towards the 
same direction.

Mechanically, whenever a Nasute soldier A discharges its Fontanellar Gun, there is a
40% chance that another Nasute Soldier B, participating in Combat but who has not yet
taken an Attack Action this Turn, will Attack the same target. Roll to randomly
select Nasute Soldier B if necessary.

The Attack is made in the Turn of the Nasute Soldier A. The Attack counts as Nasute
Soldier B's Attack for the Round (that means it can't take another Attack Action in
the same Round).

Nasute Soldier's B discharge of its Fontanellar Gun is also subject to this rule, so
it is possible, with a bit of bad luck, for all the Nasutes participating in Combat 
to discharge their guns towards the same target in one Turn, one after another, in a
chain of sticky, noxious death.
