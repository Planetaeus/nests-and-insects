END CHARACTER SHEET

Experience: Risks are how the characters gain experience (XP). Whenever the party resolves a Risk,
each character gains 1 XP to assign to any one attribute, condition, or ability.

Specific Abilities:
Carapace: If an Attack has keywords Crushing, Piercing or Shredding and the target has
Carapace > 0%, the target's Carapace rating is a negative static modifier to the Attack Roll.
Carapace also acts as a positive static modifier to any Impact rolls.

Flying_ If the target of an Attack has Flying > 0%, the target's Flying rating is a
negative, static modifier to the Attack Roll. Additionally, Close range Attacks can only
target a Combatant with Flying > 0% if the attacker also has Flying > 0%.

Web Weaving: Allows the player to set traps, secure an area, and hinder enemies. Web Weaving is
a positive static modifier to all Construction rolls and used to create structures or secure an area.
as well as all Healing rolls. Acts as a Positive Static Modifier to Web Attacks.

Swarming: A character with Swarming can summon additional creatures to fight with them as one.
Their Wound Maximum increases by Swarming / 10, rounded up. These additional wounds do not inflict
penalties when lost, but they can only be healed during the Resting & Healing minigame.
Some attacks may also change based on the number of creatures in the swarm.
When a swarm of creatures is hit by an Attack that would kill the target, it takes 2 wounds instead.

Venomous: Allows the character to inflict Poisoned on their foes. When a creature with Venomous > 0% makes an Attack Roll with the Venomous Keyword, their Venomous Rating acts as a positive static modifier

Combat:
In Combat, Characters can make one each of the following actions during their turn:
Attack Action: Make an Attack Roll
Resist Action: Resist an effect
Tactical Action: Support an Ally, Suppress an Enemy, or make a Manoeuver

Hunting and Foraging Minigame
1. Each player chooses a room to hunt or forage in. The room must have a food item or a resource in it to engage in hunting or foraging.
2. Each player declares what they are hunting or foraging. Each item in a room can only be harvested once per Hunting and Foraging Minigame.
3. Each player makes a Roll with the room's Level Rating as the Resistance. The effort depends on what they are harvesting. For a carnivore's food, make a Hunting Roll. For an Herbivore's food, make a Foraging Roll. For a Building Resource, make a Construction Roll. If the roll fails, the Room is depleted of that item. If the roll succeeds, the resource is still plentiful. Either way, make a Quantification Roll to set the rating of the item or resource.

Area Attacks: The user makes a roll against their Threat Rate. This determines whether the attack Hits or Misses. For each target in the area, use their resistance to determine if it is a partial or total hit. Then, apply all relevant modifiers for that target. Targets suffer the effects of the attack's degree of success against them, and if the attack missed against any of the targets, the attacker suffers the most egregious effects.
